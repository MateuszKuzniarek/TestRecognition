<TITLE>JOHANNESBURG GOLD SHARES CLOSE MIXED TO FIRMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold share prices closed mixed to
slightly firmer in quiet and cautious trading, showing little
reaction to a retreat in the bullion price back to below 420
dlrs and a firmer financial rand, dealers said.
    Heavyweight Vaal Reefs ended eight rand higher at 398 rand
but Grootvlei eased 40 cents at 16.60 rand, while mining
financials had Gold Fields up a rand at 63 rand despite weaker
quarterly results. Other minings were firm but platinums eased.
    Industrials also closed mixed to firmer, the index once
again hitting a new high of 1757 from Friday's 1753 finish. The
overall index also hit a new high of 2188 versus 2179 on
Friday.

<TITLE>FEEDER CATTLE FUTURES SET NEW HIGHS, TURN MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Feeder Cattle futures advanced 0.20 to
0.30 cent at the start and posted new season's highs in April
through August and October before slipping to trade 0.10 cent
lower to 0.20 higher in latest trade.
    Futures ran up to new highs at the start on general demand
prompted by continued strong cattle fundamentals. Posting of
another 10 cent gain in the latest reported average feeder
steer price added to support, traders said.
    However, prices retreated on profit-taking following the
lead of other meat pits. Stotler notably sold April on the
decline, they said.

<TITLE>VOLCKER PUSHES SPENDING CUTS OVER TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said reducing the federal budget deficit was a more
important goal for Congress than drafting trade legislation.
    "Reduce the budget deficit," Volcker responded when asked by
a member of the Senate Banking Committee about trade
legislation priorities.
    "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
you do is going to be counterproductive," he said.

not forsee a meeting with Brazil prior to the next
International Coffee Organization session in September did not
affect the market as the news was expected.
    Operators are watching the cash market for indications of
roaster interest or producer selling.

<TITLE>THATCHER FIRM AS PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR ELECTIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Colin McIntyre, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>As pressure mounted on British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to call a June election, she said
today that the decision on when to go to the county was hers
and hers alone.
    She was speaking to parliament after senior members of the
ruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due in
June 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion polls
giving her party a commanding lead.
    Asked by a Conservative back-bencher for an assurance that
the decision was hers alone, and did not depend on "media hype,
pressure and speculation," she replied: "The date of the next
election will be decided by Downing Street, not Fleet Street."
    Downing Street is the Prime Minister's official residence,
Fleet Street the traditional home of the British national
press.
    A Harris poll for the breakfast-time program TV-AM gave the
Tories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seats
in parliament, their biggest lead since the party's landslide
victory in the 1983 elections.
    In The Times of London, a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92
seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling party
with a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and the
fast-improving centrist Alliance.
    Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls in
June, Sir Marcus Fox, vice-chairman of the influential 1922
committee of Conservative back-benchers, said: "I have always
felt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view.
    "I always thought June was right. We have got most of our
legislation through and to go beyond that I do not think would
be in the national interest."
    Another Tory back-bencher, Anthony Beaumont-Dark, said: "I
have always been an October man, but I think it would be good
to get it out of the way now."
    Their comments came as government officials dismissed
speculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls
in May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent
popularity surge, Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow and
Labour's current popularity slump.
    Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concern
over a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility that
if it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overall
majority in parliament.
    Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight points
over the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the
outcome of the next election is likely to be decided.

<TITLE>WORLD SUGAR FUTURES TUMBLE IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>World sugar futures tumbled early when
sell stops were triggered at 6.60 and 6.55 cents basis the spot
contract, traders said.
    Spot May dropped 0.27 cent to 6.52 cents a lb. It opened at
6.72 cents.
    Trade houses worked both sides of the market, analysts
said.
    The decline may have been a continued reaction to the
market's inability yesterday to breach resistance around 6.93
cents basis May, which unsettled traders, analysts said.
    The market should draw support from buying tenders slated
for tomorrow and Saturday, they said.

<TITLE>GOLD AND SILVER CLOSE OFF HIGHS IN ZURICH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold and silver closed off the day's
highs on profit-taking, but silver, which continued to set the
pace, remained well up on yesterday's close, dealers said.
    Underlying speculative demand for silver remained strong
but profit-taking eroded the gains, taking the metal off
indicated highs at around 6.80 dlrs to close at 6.64/66 dlrs an
ounce. Yesterday's close was 6.52/54 dlrs.
    Some investors were noted selling gold and switching into
silver. This combined with profit-taking to push gold down to a
close of 418.50/419.00 dlrs from its opening 421.80/422.20 and
yesterday's 421.50/422.00.
    Dealers said it was unclear if the silver rally had peaked
or if fresh gains could be achieved in New York.
    "A lot depends on the Dow Jones index," one dealer commented.
"Further gains in stock prices would take away a lot of the
support for silver and gold."
    Platinum ended 50 cents higher at 563/567 dlrs.

<TITLE>CBT WHEAT FUTURES OPEN FIRMER, SET NEW HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT wheat futures opened firmer to again
set new contract highs in new crop, then back off those highs
to hold gains of 1-1/4 cents per bushel in May, with new crop
July unchanged in light early dealings.
    Steady speculative buying after yesterday's strong close
kept the chart picture very bullish and supported initial
values, traders said.
    Rumors that exporters are planning to ship SRW wheat out of
Toledo and/or Chicago, further tightening already low
deliverable stocks, kept May firm relative to new crop months,
they added.
    However, the rally failed to follow-through due to the lack
of confirmed export sales of significant quantities of U.S.
wheat so far this week, as some traders expected.

<TITLE>DOLLAR CLOSES LITTLE CHANGED IN FRANKFURT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar closed virtually unchanged
from yesterday's finish, but near the day's high after another
extremely quiet session.
    With the G-5 meeting in Washington ahead of this week's IMF
interim committee, traders remained reluctant to open any large
positions. Towards the end of the day the dollar firmed after
failing earlier to hold beneath 1.82 marks. Some dealers said
Senate testimony from Fed Chairman Paul Volcker also lent
support.
    The dollar closed at 1.8265/75 marks after opening at
1.8200/15 and closing yesterday at 1.8260/70.
    Volcker said that a further sizeable dollar decline could
be counter-productive, and that exchange rate adjustments have
been enough to narrow the U.S. Trade deficit.
    Such remarks in the past might have moved the dollar
sharply, today they only pushed it up 20 or 30 basis points
when it was already firming for technical reasons.
    The dollar in any case held in a narrow range today,
trading early in the morning just below 1.82 marks and rising
to a high of 1.8270.
    Dealers said they were awaiting comments after the G-5
meeting from U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    Looking slightly further ahead, the market is awaiting U.S.
February trade data, due on April 14.
    Another set of disappointing figures could push the dollar
below its recent 1.80-85 mark range if there have been no
supportive statements from G-5 officials in Washington in the
meantime, dealers said.
    Sterling closed slightly easier at 2.950/954 marks, after
opening at 2.951/955 and closing yesterday at 2.954/958.
    The pound has been buoyed by expectations the ruling
Conservatives will win the next U.K. Election.
    But dealers said sterling now looks high against the mark
and room for further gains must be limited.
    Many dealers believe sterling will enter the EMS joint
float after a U.K. Election. In this case, its ceiling could
well be at or near 2.95 marks, dealers said.
    The yen closed at 1.2550/70 marks per 100 after closing
yesterday at 1.2490/2510, and the Swiss franc firmed to
120.55/70 marks per 100 from 120.10/50.
    The French franc ended unchanged at 30.04/07 marks per 100.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live Hog futures ran up for gains of
0.57 to 0.07 cent in eary trade paced by April and June.
    Fairly active demand reflected strength in cash hogs and
the continued discount of futures to cash. The start of
fieldwork limited farmer movement of hogs to market and
prompted packers to bid up for hogs. Mostly steady to firm cash
pork products added to support, traders said.
    However, prices slipped from the highs in latest trade as
commercial profit-taking developed. Some selling was also
attributed to expectations that cash ham prices will be falling
soon on a seasonal basis, they said.
    Thomson and RBH bought while Packers Trading and Refco
sold. Stotler spread long June/short April, they added.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pork belly (bacon) futures ran up for
gains of 0.55 to 0.30 cent at the start and then eased to trade
0.15 cent lower to 0.15 higher in early dealings.
    Active local carryover demand and mixed commission house
buying lifted futures at the start. Higher cash hog markets on
light runs and spillover from other meat pits prompted support,
traders said.
    However, locals turned sellers along with Saul Stone and
Paine Webber and prices turned mostly lower. Trimming of gains
in other pits and expectations of possibly negative out of town
storage report this afternoon weighed on the market. Guesses on
the report ranged from in 1.0 to 2.25 mln lbs with most
indications on the high side, they noted.

<TITLE>VOLCKER SEES TIGHT POLICY HURTING INVESTMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to
investment and that a better course would be to restrain
spending.
    "A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. You
don't want to put interest rates up unless you have to," Volcker
told the Senate Banking Committee.
    "That is not a constructive way to proceed," he said.
    Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the
budget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor
squeezing the budget deficit.
    In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he
would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax
writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves
against loans to debtor countries.
    "If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans,
then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,"
Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc).

<TITLE>CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES OPEN SLIGHTLY FIRMER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soybean futures opened steady, with
new crop slightly firmer, then rallied further to hold gains of
one cent to three cents per bushel higher in light early
dealings.
    A firmer Gulf soybean basis this morning, strength in corn
futures and delays in the Brazilian soybean harvest supported
soybean futures, despite a disappointing drop in the weekly
soybean export figure yesterday afternoon, traders said.
    A local professional house and a local house were the
featured buyers of July, with sellers scattered and small-lot,
pit brokers said.

<TITLE>DOLLAR REMAINS IN NARROW RANGE IN QUIET ZURICH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar remained confined in the same
narrow range in quiet trading, benefitting only slightly from
comments by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker that further sizeable
dollar losses would be counter-productive, dealers said.
    It finished at 1.5140/50 Swiss francs after opening at
1.5128/38 and closing yesterday at 1.5185/95.
    "Volcker's remarks produced some buying interest but most
people were still waiting to see what comes out of the finance
ministers' meetings in Washington," one dealer said.
    Other currencies lost ground against the Swiss franc.
    Sterling eased after advancing sharply yesterday on
expectations of an early U.K. General election. The pound ended
at 2.4469/4501 francs compared with 2.4547/4578 yesterday.
    The mark slipped to 82.83/93 centimes from 83.11/21 and the
French franc dipped to 24.90/94 from 24.98/25.02.

<TITLE>LIFFE, AFTER RECORD VOLUMES, SEES MORE GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The records in turnover set by the London
International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) in March could
be surpassed in the coming months, Liffe Chief Executive
Michael Jenkins said.
    Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15
mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. Total
Liffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,
or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.
    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on
the year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bond
volume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.
    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected
in part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,
while the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relative
stability of U.S. Credit markets.
    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures
sector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT-
SE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in
them should be much higher by end 1987.
    FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an
increase of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the
same months of 1986.
    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the use
of stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,
Jenkins predicted.
    Commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts
and bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possible
variety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one
sector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The current
situation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Ones
changeable, might alter completely in coming months.
    A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness should
come with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added.

with soyoil up 0.13 to 0.16 cent per lb and soymeal 0.40 to

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Highwood Resources Ltd said it is not
aware of any material change in the company's affairs to
account for recent trading activity in the company's shares,
but said it anticipates being a future producer of minerals
used in electronic superconductors.
    Recent widespread publicity concerning superconductors
suggest a greatly increased demand for yttrium and lanthanide
minerals, Highwood said.
    The company said it is developing such deposits at Thor
Lake, Northwest Territories in cooperation with Hecla Mining
Co, of Idaho.

<TITLE>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOANS ROSE 42 PCT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ABIDJAN, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The African Development Bank (ADB) said
it increased its lending by 42.1 pct last year to 1.64 billion
dlrs from 1.15 billion dlrs in 1985.
    A bank statement said agriculture, set as the main growth
area in a five-year economic recovery program adopted in 1985
by African states, received 607 mln dlrs, 37 pct of the total.
    The ADB is made up of the bank itself, its financing
soft-loan arm, the African Development Fund (ADF) and the
Nigeria Trust Fund, another soft-loan institution.
    ADB president Babacar N'Diaye released a 1987 economic
report on Africa prepared by the ADB and the U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), saying progress was being made
toward substantial increases in the bank's capital resources.
    He said an ad-hoc committee of the ADB board of governors,
comprising 18 African and non-African countries, recommended a
200 pct increase in the organisation's capital for 1987-91.
    He said such an increase would raise capital from around
6.55 billion dlrs to 19.66 billion dlrs, adding he was hopeful
the proposal would be adopted at the annual meetings of the
bank and fund, due to be held jointly in Cairo in June.
    He welcomed France's recent proposals to the Paris Club of
Western government creditors to extend repayment periods for
Third World debts and give better rescheduling terms.
    "The proposition represents a major step forward. But
African countries should not be the ones to ask for large-scale
debt write-offs," he said. Africa's total external debt was
estimated at 175 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.
    The ECA-ADB report said prospects would remain bleak for
African economies in 1987 but predicted Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growth ranging between 2.5 and four pct, compared with
1.2 pct last year.

<TEXT>
<TITLE>SWEDISH FINANCE FIRMS SEEN HIT BY DEREGULATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Up to 70 pct of the 240 finance
companies operating in Sweden are likely to be squeezed out
over the next few years by the deregulation of financial
markets, the Association of Swedish Finance Companies said.
    Association chairman Arne Ogren told a news conference that
a major restructuring of the sector was inevitable.
    Central Bank governor Bengt Dennis said when announcing the
deregulation in November 1985 that one of his main aims was to
give commercial banks a chance to compete on equal terms with
finance companies and so undermine Sweden's "grey market."
    Total credit granted by the Swedish finance companies rose
to 77 billion crowns in 1986 from 64.7 billion in 1985. This
includes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of all
outstanding loans by the banking sector at end-1986.
    Ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by a
government-appointed inquiry into the credit market to license
finance companies and make them increase their share capital
were pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.
    But he said this would in fact have little effect on credit
volumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70
pct of lending by the entire sector.
    The explosive growth of Swedish finance companies began in
the early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own to
get around the tight restrictions then imposed on banking
activities and particularly on the growth of lending.
    Now that they were on an equal footing with their parent
companies, many bank-owned finance companies faced an identity
crisis, Ogren said. He predicted there would be mergers and
individual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensure
their survival in a deregulated climate.
    Ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound to
rise steeply in 1989-1990 due to the rush to increase credit.

survey by the National Institute for Economic Research showed.
    The government institute said in the survey -- of 2,000
manufacturing companies -- that industry this year planned to
reduce both raw material and finished goods inventories.
    It said domestic demand was expected to be mainly unchanged
but that exports should rise significantly. The number of firms
operating at full capacity fell slightly, however, in the first
quarter, said the report, which gave no figures.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY FUTURES STEADY BUT QUIET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. energy futures traded consistently
above yesterday's closing prices in thin activity this morning
with underlying support from April 15-day forward North Sea
Brent crude, traders said.
    April Brent traded as high as 19.40 dlrs a barrel today, or
more than 1.00 dlr above May Brent prices, because of a supply
squeeze, according to traders.
    "U.S. energy futures are probably influenced by April Brent
more than anything else today," said John O'Connell, assistant
vice president at Refco, Inc.
    May crude was up 18 cts to 18.85 dlrs a barrel.
     "There is no reason to sell energy futures at these prices
because the fundamentals have not changed," said O'Connell,
adding that the OPEC pricing/production accord continues to
hold.
    Mixed trade participants dominated crude futures while
local traders were featured in products, traders said. They
said U.S. energy futures ran into resistance at today's highs.
    May heating oil was up 0.46 cent at 49.25 cts a gallon
after trading within a narrow 0.30-cent range. May unleaded
gasoline was up 0.61 cent to 53.55 cts a gallon, at the high
end of a 0.35-cent range.

<TITLE>GERMAN LONG-TERM CAPITAL INFLOW SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The inflow of long-term capital into
West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from
January's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of
German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.
    While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of
German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold
a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public
authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.
    With German investors' purchases of foreign securities
steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were
imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.
    Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60
billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.
    There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term
capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.
    Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while
domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets
abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one
billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    Combining long and short term capital outflows, West
Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in
February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.
    The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened
to 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.
    Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted
surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In
terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of
the surplus was progressing, the bank said.
    Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion
marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on
the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,
the February current account surplus narrowed against January.
    While exports in February fell a half pct against the same
month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the
drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports
two pct.
    In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income
led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark
surplus in January.
    The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion
marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3
billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European
Community budget.

<TITLE>N.Y. COTTON FUTURES STEADY IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cotton futures were steady this morning
on commission house buying. But trade selling was keeping gains
to a minimum, brokers said.
    There was no news, but brokers said the market is 
technically weak and in search of a bottom. Recent news of poor
export sales remained a damper, brokers said.
    Cotton for May delivery was up 0.25 cent at 56.05 cents a
lb in a 56.30 to 55.80 cent range.
    December delivery was up 0.40 cent at 55.15 cents.

<TITLE>EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Commission has not taken a
decision on applications from the British government for the
release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the
British market in May and June, Commission sources said.
    They said last week's cereals management committee agreed
to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders
between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to
allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.
    However, it decided to leave consideration of the release
of further wheat until later.
    The British government had applied for the release of a
further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British
intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.
    However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review
the market situation nearer the time before giving its
approval.
    The Commission was given new powers last year to control
the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the
sources noted.
    Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry
of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that
additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made
available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged
that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes,
depending on the state of the market.
    This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission
had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the
three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting.

<TITLE>LONE STAR LCE> SEES FLAT U.S. CEMENT DEMAND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GREENWICH, Conn., April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lone Star Industries Inc
expects demand for cement om the U.S. to remain in the 85-90
mln ton range through 1992, its annual report said.
    The company said U.S. cement consumption totaled 90.6 mln
tons last year, up four pct from 1985.
    Lone Star also said it expects consolidation and
internationalization of the U.S. cement industry to continue,
adding foreign companies now own over 50 pct of U.S. capacity.
    Since 1974, it added, more  than 30 cement plants have
closed. "In our opinion, the industry's annual cement capacity
today is, in reality, less than 80 mln tons" a year, it added.
    Lone Star said the gap between supply and demand is being
filled by imported cement, which accounted for 18 pct of
domestic consumption last year, up from four pct ten years ago.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Delta Air Lines Inc said it began
construction to expand its passenger terminal facilities at
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
    Adding a new nine-gate terminal that will be connected to
Delta's existing terminal by an underground tunnel will cost
about 20 mln dlrs, a Delta spokesman said.
    The carrier will have a total of 32 gates, up from the
current 23, when the terminal is completed in late 1988.
    With the new "satellite" terminal, Delta will be able to
expand to more than 300 daily flights at the airport, up from
about 200 currently, it said.

<TITLE>LONDON OILS/SEEDS CLOSE QUIETLY MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oils and oilseeds traded quietly this
afternoon and price movements were marginally mixed.
    Dutch soyoil showed small gains with support coming from
early mark-ups in Chicago soyoil futures.
    Firm Argentine markets maintained levels in the
sunflowerseed oil section but palm oil tended to move off early
highs due to lack of buying support and the reported rejection
of rbd oil offers by Pakistan at its tender today.
    Demand for coconut oil and palm kernel oil faded and here
again early gains were pared.
    Dutch soyoil traded at 65.50 guilders for May, rising to 71
for Nov/Jan deliveries ex-mill while any origin sunflowerseed
oil sold at 346.50 dlrs for May/Jul and 357.50 for Aug/Oct call
ex-tank Rotterdam.
    No fresh trade was reported for coconut oil or palm kernel
oil and palm oil also met an idle afternoon.
    Among oilseeds, April deliveries of U.K. Rapeseed traded to
Boston, U.K. East coast, at 297 stg per tonne.

<TITLE>CASH SOYMEAL BASIS STEADY IN INCREASED TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Midwest cash soybean meal basis values
were steady, with more active trade beginning to emerge, soy
product dealers said.
    With crush margins at unfavorable levels, processors in
Indiana, South Carolina and Tennessee are cutting back
operations and preparing to take downtime, they said.
    Demand from the eastern market was steady following the
increase that emerged after the weekend snowstorm, while the
export market appeared to be cooling off, they said.
    Soyoil trade continued in the doldrums, with offers
unchanged, but could turn active if crushers continue taking
substantial downtime, dealers said.
    Spot Illinois rail 44 pct protein soybean meal was offered
at 4.00 dlrs over May, with Decatur unrestricted at 6.00 over,
and eastern delivery 5.00 over, all unchanged.
    Prompt Illinois rail 48 pct protein soymeal was offered at
20.00 over, unchanged, with Decatur unrestricted at 21.00 over,
up 1.00. Eastern delivery was quoted at 18.00 over, unchanged.
    Truck-delivered soymeal also held steady, with Danville,
Illinois quoted at 8.00 and 24.00 dlrs over for 44 and 48 pct
respectively.
    Spot central Illinois soybean oil was quoted at 0.65 to
0.70 cent per lb under May nominal, unchanged.

<TEXT>
<TITLE>JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY, MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sam Fromartz, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is attempting to cut back
semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S.
tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April
17, industry analysts said.
    The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a
possible shortage of the key computer components in the next
few weeks, the analysts said.
    "Prices have gone up for memory components, the mainstay of
the Japanese semiconductor industry," analyst Drew Peck of
Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said.
    But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far,
and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in
forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run.
    Others, however, were more optimistic, saying evidence was
already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted
sales to the grey market, the third country brokers that sell
chips at below production costs.
    "We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS, and
it has virtually dried up for EPROMS," said Merrill Lynch
analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in
computers.
    "Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are
stretching," Kurlack added.
    Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, or MITI, had requested the cut backs in
production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor
accord with the U.S.
    The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on
Japanese electronic goods, alleging that Japan had failed to
live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer
components in the U.S. market.
    But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the U.S.
was a double edged sword, and might be read at a subtle form of
trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S.
    As production in Japan is cut, these analysts argue, prices
will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor
manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long
ago exited the market for memory chips. U.S. computer makers
that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.
    "The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade
pressures from Washington, but at the same time they're
demonstating their muscle," analyst Peck said.
    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to
benefit U.S. chip makers.
    "I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.
semiconductor manufacturers," industry analyst Elliot Levine of
Ladenburg Thalmann Co said.
    But analyst Peck said, "it will take a few weeks to see
whether Japan has genuinely cut production."
    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's
request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and
production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in
plant and equipment.

<TITLE>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT RISES IN WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Loans and advances from the Dutch
Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion
guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April
6, the Bank's weekly return showed.
    Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln
guilders to 916 mln.
    These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in
the Treasury's account at the Bank, made up mainly of
repayments on housing loans by local authorities.  The
Treasury's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly
return showed.
    The Bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to
56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings
rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.
    They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the
result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank.
    Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally
changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels
since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently
around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected.
    Today call money traded between 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct and
period tariffs all between 5-5/16 to 5-7/16 pct.

     "I hope to develop a sound and comprehensive plan to

Leahy (D-Vt.) told a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing.
    Leahy faulted the Reagan administration for having no

    Leahy added that some rural countries were losing

<TITLE>KUWAIT ASKS TO USE FOREIGN FLAG TANKERS, U.S SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait has asked at least four
countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
Reagan Administration officials said.
    The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
"Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags.
    The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using
the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the
mouth of the gulf.
    "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and
possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to
carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked
not to be identified, told Reuters.
    The United States is considering the request to temporarily
transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a
move could create insurance and other problems, the officials
said.
    U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait
had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.
offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the
gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The use of generic commodity
certificates, or "certs," for fiscal years 1986-88 will save
the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture
Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
    Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the
use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5
billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could
result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.
    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450
to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net
savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.
    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the
entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been
forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.
    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been
redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would
have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.
    When asked to comment on a recent study by the General
Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net
cost to the government, Amstutz said, "GAO underestimated the
benefits and overstated the costs" of the certificate program.
    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan
entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather
than forfeitures.
    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.
    "There is no question in the mind of the Department of
Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,"
Amstutz said.
    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market
liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm
income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying
costs, he said.
    Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range
market-oriented farm policy, he said.
    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official
response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to
the subcommittee when completed.

<TITLE>LONDON EURODOLLAR DEPOSITS CLOSE QUIETLY STEADY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Eurodollar deposit rates closed little
changed around the levels established at midmorning. Rates at
the longer end of the market showed 1/16 point gains on a weak
opening from the dollar, dealers said.
    Trading remained very quiet throughout the day with
operators sidelined in the absence of major U.S. Economic data
and ahead of this week's Group of Seven meeting in Washington.
The G-7 finance ministers are due to discuss their February
pact on currency stability and this could well have an impact.
    One to five month eurodollars were steady with three months
closing at 6-9/16 7/16 pct.
    Dealers noted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would hit investment
and that a better course would be to restrain spending. Volcker
was testifying to the Senate Banking Committee.
    Volcker also said a further fall in the dollar would be
counterproductive and that the currency's performance could be
a factor in determining U.S. Monetary policy.
    Short dated eurodollars were steady with overnight to
spot/next quoted at a uniform 6-1/4 1/8 pct. The Fed added
temporary reserves via two-day system repurchase agreements
with Fed funds trading at 6-1/8 pct.

<TITLE>U.S. URGES SURPLUS NATIONS TO BOOST GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading industrial nations will be
reviewing the Paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates,
foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalances
but the U.S. thinks the accord has been successful so far, a
senior U.S. Treasury official said.
    "The Paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting. It has
been successful and continues to be succesfull," a senior U.S.
Treasury official told reporters.
    In a briefing ahead of this week's semiannual IMF and World
Bank meetings, he also said the U.S. was looking to West
Germany and Japan to bolster their economic growth.
    The official said both surplus countries, like West Germany
and Japan, and deficit countries, like the U.S., agreed to play
a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth.
    He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to
reduce its budget deficit, resist protectionism and boost U.S.
competitiveness.
    The official also said that he expected trade issues, like
the dispute between the U.S. and Japan over microchips, to be
included in the discussions.
    The official made no direct comment on the content or
schedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Seven
discussions. He said that industrial countries are concerned
that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the
international monetary system.
    He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity
to discuss economic policy coordination efforts.
    The official said indicators would be used to measure
policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic
projections.
    They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals.
    Asked whether the U.S. was proposing a new initiative
regarding the indicators, the official said the issue would be
reported to the Venice Summit in June. Monetary sources said
the U.S. proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy
coordination agreements, like the Paris Accord, more binding.

<TITLE>LONDON GOLD CLOSES OFF LOWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gold bullion ended the day easier but off
lows after strengthening during late afternoon trading in
sympathy with firmer values on Comex, dealers said.
    The metal closed at 420.00/420.50 dlrs an ounce, up on the
afternoon fix of 418.50, but still below last night's close of
421.50/422.
    It eased during the morning as dealers traded on the
gold/silver ratio, buying cheaper silver and selling gold.
Trading was quiet with interest in silver far outweighing gold.
    Gold was at its high for the day at the opening and slipped
to its low at the afternoon fix.
    Platinum ended the day at 565.50/566.50 dlrs an ounce
little changed from the afternoon fix of 566.35 or the morning
setting of 565.75, dealers said.

<TITLE>CBT CORN FUTURES HOLD GAINS AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT corn futures held gains of two to
2-3/4 cents per bushel in moderately light midsession trade.
    Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure to
about three times last year's weekly inspections, plus the
outlook for a continued active export pace due to the decline
in the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.
    Diminished PIK-and-roll activity, compared with the active
pace seen last week, added to the more positive tone.
    Most dealers expect the contract lows in corn futures to
hold, with some looking for the improving chart picture to
support a further advance.
    A local house, Cargill, the Illinois Co-op, Refco and ADM
were the featured buyers of old crop May, with Drexel/Burnham a
steady buyer in new crop December, pit brokers said.

<TITLE>NATIONAL GYPSUM DEBT UPGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Services Inc said it
upgraded upgraded to B-1 from B-3 National Gypsum Co's 887 mln
dlrs of industrial revenue and pollution control bonds.
    Moody's said a highly leveraged capital structure and thin
debt protection continues since the April 1986 leveraged
buyout.
    But the firm is well-positioned in its business segments.
As the second-largest U.S. gypsum wallboard producer, it
generates over 80 pct of operating earnings through wallboard
output. This business changes with the construction cycle and
so increases Gypsum's cash flow vulnerability, Moody's said.

<TITLE>LONDON SUGAR RALLIES FROM LOWS BY LATE AFTERNOON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Raw sugar futures rallied from session
lows by late afternoon on jobber shortcovering and trade
buying, posting pared losses from last night of 1.20 to 0.60
dlrs.
    The rally mirrored a similar upturn in New York after the
market had reacted bearishly to the realisation that new raws
offtake from China and the Soviet Union was not materialising.
    However, dealers said, sentiment was still buoyed by
prospective whites buying by India, Syria and Pakistan.
    Tomorrow's European Community (EC) tender result was
difficult to predict after last week's authorisation of 102,350
tonnes at the highest-ever subsidy of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos.
    Tomorrow's EC tender was made all the more difficult to
project by the movement last week of nearly 800,000 tonnes
sugar to intervention by operators protesting about low
rebates, dealers said.
    Near Aug was finally quoted at 154.60/154.80 dlrs
(bid-asked) from 155.80/156 last night and a session high-low
of 155.80/152.
    Volume late afternoon was 3,371 lots including nearly 2,000
lots crossed.
    London Daily Raws prices fell 3.50 dlrs on tone to 147 fob
and 171 (105.50 stg) cif and the Whites 2.50 dlrs to 190.

<TITLE>LIVE CATTLE FUTURES MIXED AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live cattle futures continued to trade
unevenly and at midsession prices stood 0.17 cent higher to
0.25 lower with spot April pacing the gain and distant April
off most.
    Mixed profit-taking continued to partly offset demand
prompted by further gains in cash cattle and private reports of
higher cash beef prices. All months posted new season's highs
early before slipping, traders said.
    Market ready supplies of cattle remain tight and a rising
wholesale carcass beef and boxed beef market is prompting good
packer interest for cash cattle. Strong stoppers of deliveries
added to strength in April, they said.

<TITLE>U.S. SAYS NO PACT ON RELIEF FOR POOREST STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>There is no consensus so far among
industrial countries on an agreement providing debt relief for
the world's poorest nations, a senior U.S. Treasury official
said.
    The official said, "There has not been a consensus reached
yet," when asked about reports the Paris club of western
creditors had agreed to long-term stretch outs of African debt
at concessional interest rates.
    The official, briefing reporters on this week's semiannual
IMF meetings, said the issue would be discussed this week and
the U.S. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to
concessional interest rate relief.

<TITLE>CBT WHEAT FUTURES EASE TO MIXED BY MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT wheat futures closed from early
contract highs in new crop to trade quietly mixed at
midsession, ranging from up 3/4 cent per bushel in May to down
3/4 in new crop July.
    After opening higher on follow-through speculative buying
after yesterday's technically strong close, prices eased on
trade-talk that some countries who were holding buying tenders
this week have rejected U.S. offers or have taken wheat from
other exporting countries, traders said.
    However, the strong chart picture probably will limit
declines, they added.
    Cargill Grain was the featured seller in new crop July,
sparking rumors that the U.S. is currently not competitive on
the World wheat market, even with government programs.

<TITLE>LME COPPER CLOSES AFTER RETREAT FROM EARLIER HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>LME afternoon ring dealings in copper
ended with three months Grade A business at 879 stg per tonne,
a rise of three from yesterday's afternoon kerb close,
equivalent to 1,410 dlrs per tonne, up four.
    However, values were off the day's highs, reflecting the
softer tone on Comex, while the cash to three months premium
narrowed to 32 stg in the absence of followthrough to earlier
nearby buying, traders said. The breakdown of the spread
premium equated to 20, seven and five stg for the first, second
and third months, respectively. Standard metal finished with an
indicated backwardation of around two stg.
    Morning ring dealings ended with forward business at a high
of 883 stg per tonne, equivalent to 1,417 dlrs. Business
featured a wave of cash pricing purchases near the official
close which established an indicated spread backwardation of 37
stg after earlier borrowing at a premium of 32, unchanged from
yesterday afternoon, traders said.
    Forward values extended pre-market gains, despite currency
factors, with short covering and some chart support evident.
    Ring dealings also included options-linked borrowing
interest from end April dates for one month at a backwardation
of 23 stg.
    Analysts said the 870 stg area appears to have provided a
minor chart support base, although upside potential remains
limited against a background of only routine physical demand
and a buoyant U.K. Currency.
    On the morning pre-market, activity was mainly dollar-based
and within the range 1,408 to 1,411 dlrs per tonne, traders
said.
    Standard grade retained a spread backwardation of 10 stg
but was tradeless.

lower to 0.25 higher in light midsession dealings.
    All but distant March posted a new season's high on general
demand before profit-taking developed. Spreading of long
deferred cattle futures/short May feeder cattle added to the
pressure in May, traders said.
    Although profit-taking weighed on prices, strong
fundamentals continued to provide support. Cash feeder cattle
remain strong on limited supplies and continued gains in live
cattle futures prompted spillover demand.
    The average feeder steer price, USFSP, rose 10 cents in the
past two reporting days, traders noted.

<TITLE>CONSOLIDATED-BATHURST SEES BETTER MARKET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it
expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the
second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued
improvement would be due to good market demand, better product
prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its
annual report.
    Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of
104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its
joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,
B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute
to equity earnings.
    Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of
80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.
    The company said it views its near-term prospects with
improved optimism.
    It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the
U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity
and production and more favorable market conditions.
    It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987
for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2
mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and
expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American
packaging divisions.
    Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa
Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes
between the United States and the European Economic Community
on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may
lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price
increases.

Second position July settled up 19 at 1,270 stg.
    The rise mostly reflected a technical consolidation of
recent losses, dealers said. Roaster interest appeared to be
tapering off and origin offers were insignificant, providing
little trading incentive.

<TEXT>
<TITLE>MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED, STUDY SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>More generic grain certificates
should be released onto the market in order for the U.S.
certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,
according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.
    The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency
payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third
certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, 
Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a
House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.
    Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly
a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.
    The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible
scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "zero
certificate case," where no certificate program was assumed,
and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" in
which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain
prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages
due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.
    The study showed that total grain use under the adequate
certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario
by 11.2 pct.
    Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain
usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the
zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.
    For the five-year period examined, government expenditures
under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or
7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.
    The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of
those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.
    The study also estimated that government grain stocks under
the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels
below the zero certificate case at the end of the period
examined.
    The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market
prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase
commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus
cash.

<TITLE>LIVE HOG FUTURES UP FURTHER AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live Hog futures recovered from early
profit-taking and ran up to new day's highs at midsession.
Futures posted gains of 0.80 to 0.12 cent paced by July.
    Early commercial profit-taking lacked followthrough and
prices ran up again on scattered demand. Computer house buying
added to strength and futures ran up to new day's highs,
traders said.
    Light hog runs and expectations of steady to higher cash
hogs again tomorrow provided the bulk of support. Farmers are
taking to the fields in some areas and sending fewer hogs to
market, they said.
    Although cash hams are called sharply lower at noon, most
traders noted this had been expected as Easter demand abated.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>World sugar futures pared their losses
by midsession when early selling dried up, allowing an easy
retracement on trade buying, brokers said.
    The market dropped sharply this morning when computer fund
pressure entered at 6.60 cents basis May, triggering heavy
stop-loss selling, brokers said.
    Spot May tumbled to 6.52 cents a lb before recovering to
6.76 cents, off 0.03 cent.
    The sell-off was a continued reaction to the market's
inability yesterday to breach resistance levels for a test of
7.0 cents basis May, brokers said.
    There was no fundamental reason for the drop, analysts
said.
    Volume at noon EDT was estimated at 11,682 lots.

<TITLE>ITALIAN BANK DEPOSIT GUARANTEE FUND APPROVED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The executive committee of the Italian
national banking association (ABI), representing the country's
major credit institutions, approved the setting up of a common
reserve fund to guarantee customer deposits in the event of
bank failures.
    ABI chairman Giannino Parravicini told a news conference
that the fund would not be operative until the latter part of
1987, and only on condition that 60 pct of banks representing
at least 75 pct of total deposits participated.
    He said the fund would initially have 1,000 billion lire
available and would cover deposits of up to three billion lire.
    A statute for establishing a deposit guarantee fund has
already been approved by the Bank of Italy and by an
interministerial committee on credit and savings.
    The 1,000 billion lire initial funding, which will be
provided through contributions from banks which opt to join the
scheme, compares with an originally targetted figure of 4,000
billion lire.
    Parravicini said the fund would be gradually increased to
4,000 billion lire by end 1991, and that the decision to
achieve this figure gradually rather than immediately was due
to fiscal considerations.
    The fund, still to be formally ratified by ABI's steering
committee, will provide 100 pct coverage on deposits of up to
200 mln lire, 90 pct on deposits between 200 mln and one
billion lire and 80 pct on those between one billion and three
billion lire.
    Assuming that all banks join the fund, contributions would
be equivalent to around 0.25 pt of a bank's total deposits.
    The ABI's steering committee later unanimously ratified the
executive committee's decision to create the common reserve
fund.

three months metal indicated from 2,355 to 2,360 stg per tonne,
equivalent to 1.7175 dlrs per lb, unchanged from yesterday's
afternoon kerb close.
    The afternoon first ring slipped to the day's low of 2,355
in very quiet trading which mostly comprised miscellaneous
carries, traders said. The session high of 2,370 stg was
reached near the official morning ring close on trade buying
before speculative profittaking and hedging operations halted
the advance, traders said. Analysts said the brief rise above
the 1.72 dlr level gave the market a slightly bullish
appearance.
    There was still borrowing interest over the last two
delivery months at a narrower contango of five stg.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soybean futures held gains of three
to 6-1/2 cents per bushel in moderately light midsession trade,
with new crop supported by local house buying.
    Slow country movement, steady to firmer cash soybean basis
values and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to support
futures from the opening, despite a disappointing drop in the
weekly soybean export figure yesterday, traders said.
    The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr
mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish,
which could limit declines when South American sales begin to
pick-up later this month, they added.
    However, some traders said new crop prices above 5.00 dlrs
a bushel could encourage some farmers to plant more soybean
acres than they originally planned.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA DISCUSSES COMMERCIAL DEBT REFINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia, which refinanced part of
its 19.7 billion dlr debt in talks with creditor governments
last week, has begun talks with banks on rescheduling its
commercial debt, the official Tanjug news agency said.
    The talks began in Washington yesterday and Tanjug said the
general attitude of the banks was "favourable."
    At the same time, other Tanjug reports showed Yugoslavia is
having difficulties in obtaining a 600 mln ECU loan from the
European Community (EC) and in receiving money owed to Yugoslav
firms by Middle Eastern countries.
    The Western creditor governments and Kuwait agreed on March
31 to refinance 475 mln dlrs of Yugoslavia's debt due in 1987
and 1988. This made possible the talks with commercial banks.
    Tanjug said sources close to the Yugoslav delegation said
the initial reaction of commercial banks was favourable despite
their continued insistence on "technical and legal elements."
    It said it was believed that a commercial debt rescheduling
would be formally agreed in the next few weeks. Bank debt
accounts for about 70 pct of Yugoslavia's overall debt, which
stood at 19.7 billion dlrs at end-1986.
    Tanjug said Yugoslavia also discussed with its commercial
creditors the idea of converting some of Yugoslavia's debt into
joint venture investments but it gave no details of this.
    It said Deputy Finance Minister Boris Skapin was holding
talks on this with representatives of Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., Which coordinates the interests of several hundred
banks in Yugoslav debt negotiations.
    In a separate report Tanjug said the EC has so far refused
a Yugoslav request for a 600 mln ECU infrastuctural loan and a
100 mln ECU grant from the EC budget. The EC had so far only
agreed to provide 380 mln ECUs towards transport modernisation.
    It said Yugoslav Finance Minister Svetozar Rikanovic
yesterday met World Bank and International Monetary Fund
officials in Washington.
    It said the World Bank agreed that infrastructural projects
in Yugoslavia should be accelerated and structural adjustment
loans should be agreed this year.

market edged towards the higher end of its current narrow
trading range, aided by a burst of cash metal pricing purchases
in the official morning rings, delers said.
    Three months delivery ended the afternoon ring at 301.50
stg, up 2.50 stg a tonne from yesterday afternoon's kerb close,
and the dollar equivalent ended around 484 dlrs a tonne.
    The cash metal buying widened the backwardation to around
seven at one stage from three stg a tonne yesterday.

<TITLE>USSR CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Gradual warming continued in most
regions of Western Soviet Union in the week ended April 4, the
Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S Agriculture and
Commerce Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency
said most of the region's precipitation fell as rain.
    The southern snow cover boundary continued to slowly
retreat northward and eastward, it said.
    Moderate to deep snow cover the northern half of the
Ukraine, northern North Caucasus, and the lower Volga, about
one month later than usual, it said.
    The agency said average weekly temperatures were below
normal in the southeast, near normal in the southwest and
northeast, and above normal in the northwest.
    Winter grains remained dormant over the region, but warm
weather promoted greening in crop areas adjacent to the Black
Sea coast, it said.

<TITLE>DOLLAR SLIGHTLY LOWER AT NEW YORK MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar remained on the defensive in
subdued dealings with few traders willing to take any major
risks ahead of this week's international monetary meetings in
Washington, dealers said.
    "Everybody is waiting for developments from the talks. In
the meantime, it's just jobbing positions back and forth," said
a dealer at one U.S. bank.
    The Group of Five, comprising the U.S., Japan, West
Germany, France and the U.K., are scheduled to convene today.
    The dollar hovered at 145.25/30 yen, down from 145.85/90
last night, and eased to 1.8255/60 marks from 1.8260/70.
    The stage for the dollar's decline was set overnight in the
Far East where the U.S. currency retreated despite steady
intervention on its behalf by the Bank of Japan.
    Dealers in Japan cited speculation that the G-5/G-7 talks
are unlikely to produce any significant or lasting measures to
stabilize currencies as one reason for the sell-off.
    No central bank intervention was detected in the U.S. where
the dollar kept well within recent trading parameters.
    Despite the view that trade and economic imbalances dictate
a downward course for the dollar, few U.S. dealers wished to
sell it aggressively before this week's meetings.
    Statements by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker
during testimony before the Senate Banking Committe failed to
rouse the market from its inertia.
    Volcker reiterated that a further, sizeable dollar decline
may be counter-productive. He also said that currency changes
that have occurred so far should be large enough -- in a
context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the
U.S. -- to support expectations for a narrower U.S. trade gap.
    "There was nothing new or remarkable there," said a dealer
at one European bank. The dollar's brief rise to 1.8270 marks
was already underway when Volcker spoke, he added.
    With the dollar becalmed, dealers looked to cross-rates,
especially sterling, yen and Swiss franc, for interest.
    Sterling continued to benefit from U.K. public opinion
polls indicating a lead for the ruling Conservative party in
any general election and following signals of an improved
economy.
    The pound hovered at 1.6175/85 dlrs, unchanged from Monday,
and at 2.955 marks, off slightly from about 2.955 last night.
    The dollar eased to 1.5120/30 Swiss francs from 1.5180/90,
and to 1.3048/53 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday.

<TITLE>LONDON COCOA CLOSES NARROWLY MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cocoa futures ended a moderate day's
trade narrowly mixed from last night at one stg down to two up
in a 2,227 lot volume including 523 crossed and 278 switches.
    Dealers said contrasting bearish and bullish factors kept
the market in narrow range trading, leaving July quoted at
1,319 stg from 1,318 asked yesterday and a high-low of
1,324/1,316.
    Prices were pressured early by firm sterling against the
dollar as well as overhead West African new crop offers.
    Opposing support was seen from prospective ICCO buffer
stock buying (possibly next week) and recent Bahia Temperao
crop forecasts at down to 1.5 mln bags, dealers said.
    The Ivory Coast was believed to have sold new crop
yesterday around 1,325 French francs per 100 kilos cif while
Ghana was also reported to be offering new crop at 1,460 stg a
tonne cif.
    Such offers were still available although the fall from
earlier highs would have made them out of reach, dealers said.
    Resale physicals were basically quiet although some
book-squaring was likely to have taken place in the run-up to
buffer stock buying, they said.

said he thought the House would approve a budget resolution
calling for 22 billion dlrs of new revenues including 18
billion dlrs of new taxes.
    "I think we will have enough votes to pass the budget
resolution and implement it," Foley told reporters.
    Asked why he thought a majority of the House was willing to
support higher taxes, Foley said, "The deficit problem has
become more apparent." President Reagan has said he will veto
any legislation raising taxes. The House is expected to act on
the budget resolution this week.

<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS HIGHER AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street demonstrated its
perseverance today as it recovered from an early wave of
selling and posted a strong advance at midday. The gain was
fueled by a strong auto sector as investors accumulated the
stocks in anticipation of bullish news later this week.
    The Dow Industrials, down 10 in the first minutes of the
session when a weak dollar and falling bond prices underscored
the market's lingering interest rate anxieties, recovered to
stand at 2417, up 11 points at midday. The broader market
showed less vigor, however, as advances eked out a lead over
declines. Volume was a strong 106 mln shares.
   Ford, up over a point for most of the session, stood at
90-5/8, up 1/2. Traders said that speculation that the company
will announce a stock split and dividend increase at its board
meeting on Thursday, encouraged the buying. Ford rose 2-5/8
yesterday.
    General Motors rose 1-5/8 to 83-1/8 in anticipation of
bullish news coming out of an analysts meeting scheduled for
Thursday and Friday, traders said. Chrysler, not expected to
make any major announcements this week, fell 1/2 to 57-3/4.
    "With the bonds weak this morning, the blue chips have been
holding the market up and that advance was sustained by an
influx of foreign money," analyst Charles Jensen of MKI
Securities said. "But poor breadth and poor performance by the
transport and utility averages and the fact the market is at
the top of its trading band supported in large part by foreign
cash, makes this market vulnerable," he said.
    Traders noted that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's
remarks today concerning the dollar's performance and its
bearing on monetary policy, injected caution into many
investors.

    In a summary of its Weather and Crops Bulletin, the agency
said planting increased in California as soil temperatures
improved.
    Texas planted 10 pct compared with an average of eight pct.
Arizona and Georgia planted 35 pct and two pct, respectively,
it said.
    Oklahoma farmers prepared 10 pct of their cotton seedbeds,
15 points below average, the agency said.

<TITLE>COMEX SILVER FUTURES HOLD GAINS AT MIDDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex silver futures held sharply
higher morning levels at midday, but further advances were
checked by overseas and commercial selling.
    May was up 12.5 cents at 6.705 dlrs as of 1223 hrs EDT.
July was up 13.1 cents at 6.785 dlrs, both exactly as they were
at 1000 hrs EDT this morning.
    Traders said locals remain long and speculative interest
continues. But profit taking has intensified on expectations of
a corrective downward move if the market becomes overbought.
    Some interest has been drawn away from silver by a further
record-setting stock market advance.

losses after starting higher, but firmed again at midsession to
post gains of 0.25 to 0.60 cent paced by February.
    Strength in other meat pits, especially live hog futures,
stimulated renewed local demand. Higher cash hog markets, light
runs as farmers take to the fields and possibly light slaughter
prompted support. Technical buying after yesterday's reversal
action added to the advance, traders said.
    Commission house profit-taking selling prompted by
expectations of a negative out of town storage report this

from in 1.0 to 2.25 mln lbs, they noted.

<TITLE>DOLLAR STEADY IN EUROPE AHEAD OF WASHINGTON TALKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar was steady ahead of a series
of meetings of leading finance ministers starting today in
Washington, despite low expectations for the outcome of the
talks and still negative underlying sentiment toward the
dollar.
    "There's too much disagreement between the Japanese and the
rest for them to come out with anything unanimous," said one
U.K. Merchant bank trader, reflecting the general tone.
    However, dealers said position squaring helped push the
dollar to a final 1.8240/50 marks, up from the opening
1.8195/205 and near yesterday's close of 1.8245/55.
    Meanwhile, the pound was underpinned by today's opinion
poll findings of further strong support for the Conservative
Party, but fear of Bank of England intervention limited buying.
    Dealers said they doubted the U.K. Central bank had needed
to sell sterling to curb rises today, with the markets so
quiet. The Bank of England was rumoured to have sold pounds
yesterday.
    Sterling ended at 72.3 pct on the trade weighted index,
unchanged from the opening but off 0.1 point from yesterday's
finish. It closed at 1.6185/95 dlrs, after an opening 1.6213/23
and previous close of 1.6163/73, and at 2.9490/520 marks,
against an opening 2.9540/75 and yesterday's 2.9490/530.
    Traders said there was little hope that the Western
financiers will be able to find a lasting solution to the
problem of currency instability during the current series of
talks in Washington.
    These are scheduled to start today with an informal Group
of Five (G-5) session.
    Tomorrow's Group of Seven meeting - of the U.S., Japan,
West Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada - is seen as
the key meeting.
    Traders said few operators will be prepared to open
positions ahead of news emerging from the talks.
    However, some traders said that, given the low level of
expectations, the market could be particularly susceptible to
signs of accord between the U.S. And Japan, which would give
the dollar a sharp upward push.
    They said interest is still largely centred on the yen,
with any fresh dollar weakness expected to show in that market
first.
    Meanwhile, today's comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker failed to have a lasting impact on the
market. His statement that a further sizeable dollar fall could
be counter-productive aided a brief run-up in mid-afternoon,
but there was little followthrough, traders said.
    The dollar finished at 145.25/35 yen, up from an opening
145.05/15 but below yesterday's European close of 146.00/10.
    It ended at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs, against the start of
1.5130/40 and previous final 1.5180/90, and at 6.0650/700
French francs, after beginning at 6.0525/75 and ending
yesterday at 6.0660/710.

<TITLE>U.S. GOLD FUTURES HOLD PARED GAINS AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex gold futures held pared gains at
midsession after the metal repeatedly stalled in the face of
trade selling resistance, analysts said.
    They attributed gold's modest price rise to a buoyant
silver market. Professional traders and investors again bought
silver on speculation it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce.
    The pacesetting June gold delivery traded at 423.60 dlrs an
ounce, up one dlr but below a session high of 425.20 dlrs.
Other contracts were 80 cts to 1.50 dlrs firmer.
    Trading was thin as participants closely watched the
foreign exchange and U.S. stock markets, brokers said.

<TITLE>DALTEX DLTX> ASSIGNED PATENT FOR SKIN THERAPY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Daltex Medical Sciences Inc said a
non-toxic, oral drug to treat skin disorders, such as redness,
scattered pimples, yellow and wrinkling associated with aging,
has been filed by the inventors and assigned to the company.
    The inventors are Dr. Albert M. Kligman and Dr. Gerd
Plewig. Kligman, a University of Pennsylvania dermatologist,
discovered the use of retinoic acid for treating acne.
    Daltex said initial tests of the drug, a retinoid compound,
have proved effective in treating "problem" skin most often
found in those over 50 and in those whose skin problems have
been aggravated by excessive sun exposure.
    In a Daltex statement, Dr Kligman said that daily doses of
the drug can "moderate or reverse" a number of skin problems
without the side effects typically associated with retinoid
compounds.
    He said more than 100 men and women in the U.S. and Germany
have been treated for six months to two years with the drug,
and said studies indicate that its therapeutic effect can be
maintained if patients take maintenance doses two or three
times a week.

<TITLE>CBT SOYPRODUCT FUTURES HIGHER AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soyproduct futures continued to
trade higher in light midsession trade, with deferred months up
most, supported by the strong tone in the nearby soybean pit,
traders said.
    Soymeal held gains of 0.70 dlr to 2.00 dlrs per tonne, with
steadiness in Rotterdam meals and U.S. cash soymeal basis
values this morning, plus trade-talk of additional processor
down-time in the U.S over the next few weeks, adding to the
positive tone in meal futures, they said.
    Merrill Lynch and E.F. Hutton were the featured outright
buyers of May soymeal, with Cargill spreading May/July at 0.20
dlr premium May, pit brokers said.
    Soyoil futures were up 0.11 to 0.15 cent per lb, supported
by steady commercial buying.

lower morning levels as some light buying emerged around the
730 dlrs equivalent level, dealers said. This saw three months
delivery end afternoon ring dealings at 456 stg, down one stg a

    In the morning, light trade selling in a thin market had
taken three months down to 730 but failed to attract any follow

<TITLE>U.S. SAYS NO PACT ON RELIEF FOR POOREST STATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Industrial countries do not agree on
ways to provide debt relief for the world's poorest nations, a
senior U.S. Treasury official said.
    A senior U.S. Treasury official said, "There has not been a
consensus reached yet," when asked about reports the Paris club
of western creditors had agreed to long-term stretch outs of
African debt at concessional interest rates.
    The official, briefing reporters on this week's semiannual
IMF meetings, said the issue would be discussed this week and
the U.S. had an open mind on the proposal but it did object to
concessional interest rate relief.

<TITLE>BIFFEX FALLS FURTHER BY CLOSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dry cargo futures on BIFFEX extended
early losses during the afternoon session to close 30 to 52
points lower because of uncertainty as to where the physical
market will go in the near term, dealers said.
    Initial panic profit-taking snowballed and triggered
further sell stops. A 2.5 point fall in the Baltic Freight
Index to 1030.5 further dampened sentiment after its strong
advance over the past week, they added.
    Rumours of lower rates circulated the market this
afternoon, but some dealers said easier fixtures talked of
today involved older tonnage and may not be representive of
current conditions.

<TITLE>COCOA/COFFEE/SUGAR TRADE NEWS/MARKET COMMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 7 - Cocoa physical trade - </DATELINE><BODY>West African
origins believed near market, especially Ivory and Ghana. Ivory
reported traded yesterday around 1,325 French Francs per 100
kilos cif for new crop while Ghana was offering at 1,460 stg a
tonne cif, also for new crop... Offtake small, restricted to
dealer book-squaring ahead of buffer stock buying which
possibly next week, some say... Ghana resale June/Aug 60 stg
over Sep.
    Cocoa comment/market talk - Terminal on defensive on firm
sterling and overhanging West African new crop offers, but
prospective buffer stock buying and lower Bahia Temperao crop
(possibly down to 1.5 mln bags from 2.0/2.5 mln) constructive.
    Sugar physical trade - Malta tendering for 3,000 tonnes
whites today for arrival in two equal parts in May and June. No
news by late afternoon... India in tomorrow for one/two cargoes
whites with Syria tendering same day for 36,000 tonnes whites
for June/July/Aug shipment... EC export tender tomorrow but
after last week's heavy authorised exports (102,350 tonnes) at
the highest ever-rebate of 46.864 Ecus per 100 kilos, and with
move to intervention of near 800,000 tonnes, tomorrow's result
is anybody's guess, traders said... Pakistan tendering
Saturday.
    Sugar comment/market talk - Afternoon terminal rally after
fall which had been linked to lack of Soviet/Chinese offtake.
    Coffee physical market - Origin offers scarce and roaster
demand quieted down... Roasters may be adequately covered for
time being after Brazilian, Colombian and Mexican sales over
the past week.
    Coffee market talk and comment - Futures quietly firmer,
but trade featureless. Prices seem to be consolidating at
current levels following recent declines, but will need further
signs of demand to sustain support, dealers said... With Brazil
May registrations out of the way, market is awaiting fresh
fundamental news to provide direction.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Platinum futures were higher at
midsession as the precious metal continued to mirror the action
in the nearby silver pit, analysts said.
    Silver was trading in the upper end of the day's wide
range, bolstered by speculative buying on a belief that it
would continue to rise toward seven dlrs an ounce basis May.
    The key July platinum delivery traded at 571.50 dlrs an
ounce, up 2.90 dlrs but under a session high of 577.50 dlrs.
Other months were 3.70 to 7.30 dlrs higher.
    However, trading was thin as many participants watched the
foreign exchange and U.S. stock and bond markets.
    Meanwhile, palladium was up 70 cts to 2.20 dlrs in
sympathetic buying to platinum.

Ivan Boesky's Seemala Corp, consented to Securities and
Exchange Commission penalities and agreed to help in its
continuing investigation of insider trading, the SEC said.
    Davidoff recently pleaded guilty in federal court to
violating the net capital requirements governing brokers and
traders.
    The SEC had filed similar charges and it said Davidoff had
consented to a final judgement enjoing him from future stock
trading violations.
    The SEC said Davidoff consented to its order without
admitting or denying the allegations that he aided and abetted
violations by a broker and dealer.
    It also said Davidoff consented to a planned SEC order to
bar him from future securities dealings.

<TITLE>U.S. LIVESTOCK STRESSED BY WEATHER--USDA/NOAA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Snow and freezing temperatures
stressed livestock in the eastern half of the United States in
the week ended April 5, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility
of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said.
    In a summary of its weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, the
agency said most Nebraska and Kansas livestock are fair as calf
losses from the storm during the week were variable.
    Calving and lambing continued.
    Freezing temperatures slowed pasture growth in most areas,
the agency said.

<DATELINE>    BANCROFT, Iowa, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>An explosion and fire today
damaged a grain elevator in Bancroft, Iowa, destroying
thousands of bushels of grain, authorities said.
    The pre-dawn explosion ripped the wooden elevator open, and
a fire that followed continued burning at late morning but had
been contained, according to a dispatcher at the Algona Police
Department.
    No injuries were reported at the Lone Rock Coop facility.
    The dispatcher said the elevator was filled with corn, and
a nearby drying building holding soybeans was on fire.
    The explosion was the second in four days in Iowa following
the destruction of an Archer Daniels Midland elevator in
Burlington last Friday.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKETS MIXED AT MIDSESSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. credit markets were mixed in dull
trading at midsession, with moderate losses in coupon issues
and Treasury bill rates near unchanged.
    Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reserve
chairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would
be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in
U.S. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was
not connected with Fed policy, dealers said.
     Coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weak
dollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis
points lower to one basis point higher.
    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32
to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.
    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to
narrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,
sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little
exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his
views.
    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under
pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations
meet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.
    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the
session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but
that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.
    "When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it
makes people think the Fed is not going to tighten," a bill
trader said. "But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers."
    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points
below their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills
rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.
    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.
    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply
temporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect
injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a
direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed
conducted at its usual intervention time.
    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8
pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,
down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.
    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at
midday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.

<TITLE>LIVE HOG FUTURES TRIM SHARP GAINS AT CLOSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Live Hog futures ran up for sharp gains
after midsession before slipping late to close 0.82 cent higher
to 0.02 lower. Only February posted a loss while April and June
paced the gain and April ended at 50.65 cents.
    Futures ran up early as demand prompted by strong live
markets, light hog runs and the discount of futures to cash
sparked technical buying. April ran up as much as 1.42 cents
above its previous level before profit-taking developed,
traders said.
    Gains in cash hogs reflected reduced farmer marketings as 
they took to the fields for the start of spring activities. The
strength in live also offset a sharp break in cash ham prices.
The break in hams was expected as Easter buying came to an end,
they added.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT soybean futures closed on a strong
note in new crop, showing gains of 4-3/4 to 9-1/4 cents per
bushel in moderate trade. May settled at 5.04-1/2 dlrs after
posting a 5-1/2 cent range, with November at 5.04-3/4.
    Slow country movement, steady to firmer cash soybean basis
values and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to support
futures from the opening, despite a disappointing drop in the
weekly soybean export figure yesterday, traders said.
    The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr
mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish,
which could limit declines when South American sales begin to
pick up later this month, they added.
    A local house steadily bought new crop November, with
another local house spreading July/Nov, pit brokers said.

<TITLE>PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC PE> REPLACES ENGINEER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PHILADELPHIA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Philadelphia Electric Co said the
Operations Engineer at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station
has been replaced with another nuclear experienced, qualified
engineer holding a senior operator license at Peach Bottom.
    Early last week, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ordered that unit three of the nuclear power plant
be shutdown after determining that operators were sleeping on
duty.
    In a letter to the commission detailing actions taken as a
result of that order, the utility said the Operations Engineer
had been reassigned to corporate headquarters on April 6.
    Releasing its letter to the NRC, Philadelphia Electric said
it "will have no future comment on this response pending
Nuclear Regulatory Commission disposition" of the case.
    Effective April 11, the utility said, it is establishing
24-hour coverage of operations by at least one independent,
nuclear experienced engineer or physicist per shift posted
within the control room complex who will report directly to the
company's Superintendent of Nuclear Operations Quality
Assurance Division at corporate headquarters.
    Immediately after receipt of the NRC order, Philadelphia
Electric said, Senior Plant Management began making unannounced
control room visits during the night shift, adding this
activity will continue until the planned additional 24-hour
coverage operations are in place.

<TITLE>KANSAS CITY WHEAT LOSES EARLY GAINS, ENDS LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KANSAS CITY, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hard wheat futures closed 1-1/4 to
1/2 cents lower in light trading as exporter selling erased
early gains to close the market near session lows, traders
said. May closed 1-1/4 cents lower at 2.72-3/4 dlrs.
    Prices opened steady to higher on some follow-through
buying from yesterday and hopes for new export sales in tenders
scheduled this week. But selling by a major exporter brought
prices off their highs, and the lack of strong buying interest
reversed those gains.
    Volume remained generally thin with little other fresh news
in the market. Cargill sold 1.0 mln bushels of May, and Staley
bought May and July, pit brokers said. Some intra-market
spreading was noted with players on both sides of July/December
at 7-1/2 cents, they said.

<TITLE>CANADA LAWMAKERS URGE EXEMPTION FROM U.S. BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lawmakers from Ontario asked their
U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade
retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered
by the U.S. Congress.
    At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an
organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the
Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said
the exemption would help trade relations.
    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in
late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would
harm the U.S. economy.
    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any
grounds.
    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.
congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has
to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."
    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You
do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely
consider exempting our country from that bill," he added.

<TITLE>N.Y. PLATINUM FUTURES FINISH HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Platinum futures finished higher as 
the metal continued to follow the strong silver market,
analysts said.
    The key July platinum delivery settled at 572.20 dlrs an
ounce, up 3.60 dlrs but below a session high of 577.50 dlrs.
Other months gained 3.70 to 4.60 dlrs.
    However, steady trade selling and skittish speculators kept
platinum well below session highs. "Most metals players are in
the silver pit, not here," said one floor analyst.
    Meanwhile, palladium ended 25 to 50 cts firmer, but also
under the day's highs, in sympathy.

<TITLE>U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>New immigration rules relating to
alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S.
Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress,
sources on Capitol Hill said.
    USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that
would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the
cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable
commodities.
    The department is considering including in its definition
of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,
Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,
the New York Times reported yesterday.
    Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the
definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which
is "a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,"
Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.
    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying
USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty
provision, farm industry sources said.
    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said
livestock producers were "desperate" because they fear they will
be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined
that industry.
    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986
immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress
did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers
who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and
Spanish reeds was "marginal."
    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration
of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the
the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees
"a tough call," this source said.
    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation
except to say it was subject to change before it will be
released, probably some time later this month.
    While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under
consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is
not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration
question, congressional sources said.
    The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers
was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.
    Congressional staff members estimate the special farm
worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to
350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who
worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply
for temporary, then permanent, resident status.

<TITLE>CUBA CRUDE SUGAR HARVEST FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAVANA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cuban president Fidel Castro told a
Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the
production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress
is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule.
    In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paper
GRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously
interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the
central and western parts of the island.
    The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters
scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were
particularly "vulnerable," as muddy fields prevent operations.
    Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures
to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present
harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign.
    However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the
country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2
mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest
was 8.2 mln tonnes.
    The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the
present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the
official said.

<TITLE>ATT T> GETS GEORGIA RATE REDUCTION APPROVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) approved its 4.1
mln dlr rate restructuring proposal to reduce intrastate long
distance rates by about 4.4 pct.
    ATT said it will file new prices at the PSC in August to
meet a Sept. 1 effective date set by the commission.
    The telephone company said it asked the PSC on Nov. 7 for
permission to increase its prices for intrastate private line
services, used mainly by large business customers, which ATT
said were priced below its access costs.
    "Private line service has been grossly underpriced since
1984, and, therefore, it has been subsidized by all long
distance users," Terry Hobbs, assistant vice president said.
    "As a result of today's PSC decision to allow our private
line service prices to cover their access costs, these
subsidies will end and we'll be able to reduce basic long
distance rates for everyone," he added.

<TITLE>CBT CORN FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER ON FIRM NOTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT corn futures closed on or near the
highs, up 1-1/4 to three cents per bushel, with May settling at
1.59-1/2 dlrs after posting a 1-1/2 cent range.
    Slow country movement, yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly
corn export figure to about three times last year's weekly
inspections, plus the outlook for a continued active export
pace due to the decline in the U.S. dollar this year, supported
nearbys, traders said.
    Many traders said they were mystified why Drexel Burnham
was such an aggressive buyer today in new crop December.
    Farmers will probably plant as many acres as allowed under
the government programs and near-record yields must be assumed
at this time because they will aggressively apply fertilizer to
prime yielding acres, one commercial trader noted.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pork belly futures traded on both sides
of previous levels in choppy action before closing 0.62 cent
lower to 0.70 higher. July paced nearbys lower while March led
next year contracts higher. May ended at 66.17, off 0.22 cent.
    Uneven price moves persisted as locals traded on both sides
of the market. Local and wire house buying lifted prices early
before locals turned sellers and touched off stop loss orders,
traders said.
    Expectations by some traders that this afternoon's out of
town storage report would be negative to futures offset early
support generated by higher live hog markets and light hog
runs, they said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex silver futures made session highs
on the close, settling with gains of 18.5 to 20.4 cents.
Settling prices also set new highs for the recent move, as
speculative buying overcame midsession profit taking.
    Locals and commercial traders who went short today,
expecting a corrective move, bought back positions. Those who
went long weeks ago are still reluctant to sell, traders said.
    Analysts said speculators continue to find silver a bargain
relative to gold and are snapping up the metal as a cheap
inflation hedge.
    May closed 18.5 cents higher at 6.765 dlrs. July was up
18.7 cents at 6.841 dlrs. Open interest at yesterday's close
rose to 109,534 contracts, a new high for the move. Estimated
volume today was 38,500 lots, including 4,326 switches.

<TITLE>WORLD SUGAR FUTURES RALLY LATE, SETTLE HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>World sugar futures settled higher,
strengthening late on shortcovering and technically-based
buying, analysts said.
    The rally gained momentum "when traders realized they could
get a key reversal," a commission house analyst said. But the
market showed signs of continued resistance near 7.0 cents
basis May, he noted.
    May delivery exceeded yesterday's low and yesterday's high
before settling at 6.94 cents a lb, up 0.15 cent.
    Values tumbled this morning when computer fund selling
triggered sell-stops at 6.60 cents and under. But contracts
recouped most of those losses by midsession on trade buying,
brokers said.
    Estimated volume was 20,339 lots.

<TITLE>LUMBER FUTURES TRIM LOSSES AT CLOSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Lumber futures recovered from lows to
close 3.10 to 0.10 dlrs per tbf lower. May paced the setback
and ended at 187.70 dlrs.
    Futures moved lower all morning on long liquidation. Stop
loss orders added to the setback before late shortcovering
trimmed losses, traders said.
    Pressure reflected declines in financial futures, which
prompted concern that interest rates may rise, and private
reports of further weakness in cash product. Demand for spruce
is slow and mills are looking for buyers, they noted.
    Shearson, Merrill, Shatkin, Dean Witter and Cargill sold on
the decline. Merchants spread long May/short September at one
time, they added.

<TITLE>YEUTTER WARNS CONGRESS ON TRADE RETALIATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter said that if Congress were to require trade
retaliation, it would only close markets and would result in
less trade.
    In remarks prepared for an address to members of the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, Yeutter
said many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly
protectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to close
off market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement is
unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several
years.
    "Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite the
President's comprehensive competitiveness initiative, there are
many in Congress who still are supporting trade bills
containing many dangerous provisions," Yuetter said.
    Yeutter said many countries would prefer U.S. retaliation
to opening their own markets. "We should be intelligent enough
to not let them off the hook that easily," he said.
    He said that tough but flexible legislative language is
infinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language.
    Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirable
limits on Presidential discretion, he said.
    "Limiting the President's ability to consider all available
options on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise,"
Yeutter said. "That could readily provoke retaliation, which
would unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars, injuring most
competitive export industries."
    Yeutter said present U.S. trade laws are fundamentally
sound.
    President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliation
eight times in the last 18 months -- most recently in the case
of Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets.
    "He took these steps as a last resort, only after carefully
analyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis and
only after determining that such actions would open markets to
American exports", he said.
    Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve the
U.S. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. He added
that the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomic
policy shortcomings here and abroad.

<TITLE>U.S. GOLD FUTURES END STRONGER, NEAR DAY'S HIGHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Comex gold futures closed stronger and
near the day's highs, underpinned by a buoyant silver market,
brokers said.
    Silver again set the pace for the precious metals. Silver
posted a sharp rise on continued speculative purchases amid
hopes it would soon hit seven dlrs an ounce in the May
contract. Silver finished near session highs, analysts noted.
    Gold for delivery in June settled at 426.20 dlrs an ounce,
up 3.60 dlrs and just slightly under a day's high of 426.50
dlrs. Gold bullion rose to 422.25/3.25 dlrs from 418.10/60 dlrs
yesterday. Other contracts rose 3.60 to four dlrs.

<TITLE>IRAQ CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES SWITCHED - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) has transferred 21.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
previously earmarked for sales of U.S. corn and 5.0 mln dlrs
for sales of oilseeds to increase available coverage on sales
of U.S. poultry meat to Iraq, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said.
    The department said the action was taken at the request of
Iraq's State Trade Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs.
    The guarantee line for sales of corn has been reduced from
78.0 mln dlrs to 57.0 mln and the line for oilseeds from 5.0
mln dlrs to zero.
    The guarantee line for sales of frozen poultry has been
increased from 30.0 mln dlrs to 56.0 mln dlrs, USDA said.

<TITLE>CBT WHEAT FUTURES RALLY TO CLOSE HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>CBT wheat futures rebounded from
midsession lows to close 2-1/2 cents to 1/4 cent per bushel
higher in light trade. May settled at 2.88-3/4 dlrs after
posting a 2-3/4 cent range on the day.
    After opening higher on followthrough speculative buying
after yesterday's technically strong close, setting contract
highs in new crop, prices eased on trade talk some countries
who were holding buying tenders this week have rejected U.S.
offers or have taken wheat from other exporting countries,
traders said.
    However, the strong chart picture and strength in corn and
soybeans provided solid background support for wheat.
    Cargill was the featured seller in new crop July, sparking
the midsession selloff.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SETS UP SPECIAL DEBT COMMISSION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rene Villegas, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil has set up a special debt
commission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to be
responsible for renegotiating Brazil's 109 billion dollar
foreign debt, officials said.
    The principal negotiator on the commission, created by
President Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister Ramiro
Saraiva Guerreiro.
    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commission
by eight senior officials, including a representative of the
National Security Council.
    The creation of the commission is intended to underscore
the Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue is
essentially political and that a political solution must be
found to the problem.
    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68
billion dollar foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.
    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they are
equally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.
    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the United States for fresh
debt negotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia's
suspension of interest payments.
    Funaro was due to hold talks in New York today with the
private sector, before travelling to Washington for the semi-
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.
    Officials said the new commission would start work in
earnest when Funaro returns from the United States.
    Yesterday Funaro called for a new forum for discussion of
the foreign debt. He suggested direct participation of the
governments of creditor countries in debt talks.
    In negotiations on commercial debt, talks have
traditionally been restricted to banks.
    The creation of the new commission brings Brazil's highly
professional Foreign Ministry much more into the forefront on
the debt issue than it has been in the past.
    During the period of military rule, which ended in 1985,
the Foreign Ministry played a very minor role in debt policy.
    But the new commission has diplomats among its members and
the chief negotiator, Saraiva Guerreiro, is a seasoned envoy
with a long diplomatic career.

<TITLE>DEERE DE> AND UNIT DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded 1.8 billion dlrs of long-term debt of Deere and Co
and its finance unit John Deere Credit Co.
    Downgraded were senior notes and debentures to Baa-2 from
A-3 and subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Baa-1. The senior debt
includes John Deere Credit Co's guaranteed Eurobonds.
    Moody's cited lower agricultural equipment demand due to
depressed conditions in the farm economy. It also noted that
equipment prices are pressured by competition. Deere is the
industry's dominant producer but overcapacity keeps cash flow
and debt protection measures under pressure, Moody's noted.

late dealings when trade selling dissipated, allowing local and
speculative buying to increase, brokers said.
    The market settled 0.75 to 0.50 cent stronger, with spot
May ended 0.70 better at 56.50 cents a lb.
    May got as high as 56.75 cents but profit-taking by early
buyers trimmed gains, brokers said.
    Early demand came from traders convinced that the market
was technically oversold, brokers said.
    Trade buying bolstered new-crop contracts, brokers said.
December settled 0.72 cent firmer at 55.47 cents.

sympathy with strength in new crop soybeans, with soymeal up
1.30 to 3.00 dlrs per ton and soyoil 0.19 to 0.15 cent per lb
higher. May soymeal settled at 146.60 dlrs, with soyoil at

    Steadiness in Rotterdam meals and U.S. cash soymeal basis
values this morning, plus trade talk of additional processor
down-time in the U.S. over the next few weeks, added to the
positive tone in meal futures, they said.
    A local house bought over 600 contracts of July soymeal,
with C and D Commodities, Dean Witter, E.F. Hutton and Merrill
Lynch buying small amounts of nearbys, pit brokers said.
    Commercials were the featured buyers in soyoil, with

<TITLE>GENCORP GY> SAYS BUYBACK BETTER THAN TAKEOVER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AKRON, Ohio, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>GenCorp Inc said the decision by
General Partners, comprised of AFG Industries and Wagner and
Brown, to end its hostile offer for the company supports its
belief that the buy back offer it announced yesterday was a
"financially superior alternative."
    GenCorp said it would annouce details of its plans to buy
back 54 pct of its stock for 1.6 billion dlrs, or 130 dlrs a
share, later this week. GenCorp's buy back was made to fend off
the hostile 2.3 billion dlr, 100-dlr-a-share, tender offer by
AFG and Wagner and Brown.
    Earlier today AFG and Wagner and Brown said that without
the benefit of additional information available to GenCorp's
management, it cannot compete economically with GenCorp's
proposal.
    The group said it is ending its tender offer for GenCorp
and promptly return to tendering shareholders all shares
tendered pursuant to its offer.
    The group owns 9.8 pct, or 2,180,608 shares, of GenCorp's
outstanding shares.

<TITLE>CCC CREDITS FOR BANGLADESH AMENDED - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) has reallocated 5.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
previously earmarked for sales of U.S. wheat to provide
coverage for sales of U.S. vegetable oil to Bangladesh, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    USDA said the action was taken at the request of the
Bangladesh government and reduces the guarantee line authorized
for wheat sales from 25.0 mln dlrs to 20.0 and creates a new
line of 5.0 mln dlrs for vegetable oils.
    To be eligible for coverage under the CCC's Intermediate
Export Credit Program, credit terms must be in excess of three
years, but not more than seven years.
    All sales covered by the credit guarantees must be
registered and shipped by September 30, 1987, USDA said.

<TITLE>NY COCOA FUTURES CLOSE MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cocoa futures drifted into a dull
finish, settling at nine dlrs lower to seven higher, with most
contracts near unchanged from midday levels.
    May closed nine dlrs lower at 1,925 dlrs. Estimated volume
was 1,461 contracts.
    Light selling based on weak London prices and continued
offers by West African origins applied light pressure.
    A report from London that traders question the supportive
potential of newly-negotiated buffer stock rules was also
depressing to prices, analysts said.
    Bahia arrivals now total a cumulative 6,475,385 bags,
private Brazil trade sources said, half a mln bags above the
year ago count.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said tonight its forces were
battling to dislodge Iranian troops from territory they gained
during a new three-pronged offensive on the war front near the
southern city of Basra.
    The third High Command communique issued during the day
said the Iranians launched a major overnight assault on the
fronts of three Iraqi divisions, the Qutaiba, Muthanna and
Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    It said the Iranian troops which attacked the Qutaiba front
were completely annihilated but the invading force managed to
gain some footholds on the other fronts.
    "Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all
morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iranians
from all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front and
the situation ended in Iraq's favour," the communique said.
    It said Iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to
drive the Iranians from the few positions they were still
holding on the front of the Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    The precise locations of the three fronts were not given.

<TITLE>NY COFFEE FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>N.Y. coffee futures closed higher again
today on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller
near term, analysts said.
    In addition, roaster demand emerged in some forward
deliveries, while earlier trade selling around the 102.50 cent
level in the May retreated. May closed 2.21 cents higher at
104.25 cents, its highest close since March 30.
    Analysts said the market has now fully discounted the fact
that there most likely will not be fresh ICO coffee quota talks
until September. "It's now starting to focus more on the day to
day, a possibly oversold condition, and some roaster interest,"
one analyst said.
    Estimated volume was 3,605 contracts.
    July was up 2.25 cents at 106.25 cents.

<TITLE>IRAQ REPORTS FIERCE FIGHTING TO REMOVE IRANIANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said its forces were battling to
dislodge Iranian troops from territory they gained during a new
three-pronged offensive on the war front near the southern city
of Basra.
    The third High Command communique issued during the day
said the Iranians launched a major overnight assault on the
fronts of three Iraqi divisions, the Qutaiba, Muthanna and
Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    The communique said the Iranian troops which attacked the
Qutaiba front were annihilated but the invading force managed
to gain some footholds on the other fronts.
    "Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all
morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iranians
from all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front and
the situation ended in Iraq's favour," the communique said.
    It said Iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to
drive the Iranians from the few positions they were still
holding on the front of the Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    The precise locations of the three fronts were not given. A
previous Iranian offensive launched in January towards Basra,
Iraq's second city, was halted with Baghdad saying the Iranians
had gained only a narrow strip of Iraqi territory.

<TITLE>WESTMIN TO RAISE MYRA FALLS CAPACITY BY 33 PCT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CALGARY, Alberta, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Westmin Resources Ltd said it
plans to increase capacity at its Myra Falls, British Columbia,
base and precious metal mine and mill complex by 33 pct to
4,400 short tons of ore a day, subject to regulatory approvals.
    The company said the expansion will cost about 24 mln dlrs
and could be in operation by 1988.
    Economies of scale from the expansion should pay back net
expansion cost in less than one year, Westmin said.
    The Myra Falls complex processed 3,257 tons of ore a day
during 1986. Myra Falls 1986 production was 44,000 ounces of
gold, 966,266 ounces of silver, 45.5 mln lbs of copper, 96.2
mln lbs of zinc and 777,000 lbs of lead, a company spokesman
said.

<TITLE>N.Y. FCOJ FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Frozen concentrated orange juice
futures closed 2.60 to 0.80 cents higher, though the market
failed to hold early gains of as much as 4.40 cents in the July
delivery. Estimated volume was 1,000 contracts.
    May was up 1.70 cents at 132.90 cents, off a high of 133.50
cents. July was up 2.60 cents at 131.70 cents.
    Speculative short covering early in the session pushed the
market up, after locals succeeded in triggering stops over
132.00 cents in the May. The trade was an early buyer as well
but turned seller at the top, taking profits and knocking
prices off the early highs.
    The afternoon session was quiet and prices remained steady.
Traders said spot May now roughly reflects the ex-dock price of
Brazilian juice.

in sympathy with strength in the Chicago soybean complex, with
grains mixed in quiet trade.
    Rapeseed futures ended with gains of 2.60 to 3.30 dlrs per

<TITLE>U.S. DEBT FUTURES CLOSE DOWN, NEAR DAILY LOWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. debt futures closed down and near
daily lows after a choppy session.
    Continued weakness in the dollar pressured the market.
Bearish sentiment prevailed despite remarks made by Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker that a further large drop in the
dollar could be counterproductive to the world economy.
    New agreements by the G-5 and G-7 nations, which are
meeting this week, on stabilizing currency rates are expected
to have little effect on the market, traders said.
    June T-bonds again failed to take out resistance at
98-16/32 as well as fill a chart gap between 98-25/32 and
99-16/32.
    CBT T-bonds closed 28/32 to 30/32 point lower, T-notes fell
20/32 and muni bonds ended down one point. IMM T-bills ranged
from 7 basis points lower to 2 basis points higher and
Eurodollars closed down 6 to 11 basis points.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded Dayton Hudson Corp's 1.3 billion dlrs of debt.
    The agency cut to Aa-3 from Aa-2 Dayton Hudson's senior
notes, debentures, revenue bonds and Eurodebt, and shelf
registration to Provisional Aa-3 from Provisional Aa-2.
    Moody's said it expected that leverage, which has risen
because of an aggressive expansion program, would remain high
due to the company's spending plans. The agency noted that
Dayton Hudson's operating returns recently declined.
    But Moody's also said the company's recent operating
problems would probably be temporary.

<TITLE>WALL STREET CLOSE SHARPLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Wall Street's fears about interest
rates and inflation were reignited today, triggering a sharp
selloff in active trading. Profit taking and arbitrage related
sell programs, taking a cue from falling bond prices, combined
to pound the market sharply lower.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which soared 85 points to
record levels in the past two sessions, tumbled 45 points to
close at 2361 today. It was the fourth biggest decline in the
market's history. Declines led advances three-one as volume
rose to 188 mln shares from the 174 mln that traded on Monday.

<TITLE>CANADA STOCKS CLOSE LOWER ON PROFIT TAKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toronto stocks, higher at midsession,
closed lower as a bout of profit taking on Wall Street spilled
over to Canadian markets, analysts said.
    The composite index dipped 10.20 points to 3871.00,
although advances narrowly led declines 518 to 507 on very busy
volume of 39.7 mln shares. The 300-share composite index soared
139 points in the last three sessions.
    "By and large, we had a good dose of profit taking today,"
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst John Ing commented. "It is
more developments in the U.S. that appear to be influencing
stock prices up here," he added.
    Interlisted issues led the Toronto market lower, analyst
Ing said. Seagram fell 2-1/8 to 100-3/8, Northern Telecom slid
1-1/2 to 58-1/2 and leading active trader Canadian Pacific lost
1/4 to 24-3/4.
    Forest product stocks, making strong gains in recent
sessions, traded mixed. MacMillan Bloedel lost 3/8 to 28-3/4,
third top active British Columbia Forest Products was unchanged
at 20-3/4 and Canfor Corp rose 1/2 to 35 dlrs.
    Consolidated-Bathurst firmed 1/8 to 21-1/8. It said it
expects the improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in
the second half of 1986 to continue this year.
    Gold producer Galactic Resources jumped 1-1/8 to 10-3/8. It
said yesterday it plans to merge with Quartz Mountain Gold and
said Cornucopia Resources granted an option to enter in a
Nevada joint venture.
    Other precious metals strengthened against the lower trend.
Hemlo Gold advanced 7/8 to 27-1/4 and Lacana Mining climbed
1-3/8 to 18-1/2. Base metal stocks turned lower in the
afternoon after early gains. Falconbridge eased 1/8 to 19-3/4,
Inco slipped 1/8 to 21-5/8 and Noranda lost 1/8 to 32 dlrs.
    Montreal's market portfolio index fell 12.52 points to
1922.51. The Vancouver index rose 9.9 points to 1883.9.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. energy futures posted modest gains
because of a supply squeeze in physical North Sea Brent crude
oil
and escalation of the Iran/Iraq war, traders and analysts said.
    May crude closed 17 cts higher to 18.84 dlrs.
    "Energy futures were led by the 15-day forward Brent Crude
market in Europe, said Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F.
Hutton and Company Inc, adding, "crude futures could jump above
19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are
not strong," he added.
    April Brent rose as high as 19.57 dlrs a barrel today.
    Traders said reports that Iran opened a new southern front
and Iraq attacked Iranian oil fields were also supportive.
    Murphy said tonight's American Petroleum Institute report
will need to show drawdowns in gasoline and distillate of two
to four mln barrels each to support firmer crude prices.
    "There is a lot of gasoline around," Murphy said.
    Following crude futures, May gasoline closed 0.33 cent
higher at 53.27 cts a gallon after trading 8,700 contracts. May
heating oil traded only 7,200 contracts and was up 0.45 cent at
49.24 cts.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said President Reagan should have the authority and
responsibility for deciding if and when to award import relief.
    "As the only nationally-elected official in the government,
only the president can weigh all the factors that go into
determining whether or not it is in the national economic
interest to do so," he said in a prepared address to the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
    Yeutter was commenting on proposed changes in the law which
would transfer to the trade representative much of the current
retaliatory power held by the White House, which has been the
target of congressional dissatisfaction on trade issues.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
affirmed the debt ratings of 3.7 billion dlrs of debt of United
Technologies Corp and its units.
    Affirmed were the Aa-3 senior debt of the parent and its
units United Technologies Credit Corp, United Technologies
Financial Services Inc, United Technologies Finance N.V.,
Carrier Corp and Carrier International Finance N.V. Also
affirmed were the parent's Prime-1 commercial paper, Aa-3
Euroyen bonds and A-1 preferred stock.  United Technologies
Credit Corp's A-1 subordinated debt was also affirmed, Moody's
said.
    Moody's cited its expectations that the company's programs
will be successful in lowering operating costs and improving
intermediate-term capital management. This will raise financial
measures from current low levels.
    As operating earnings and cash flow of the companies
increase as a result of the programs, balance sheet leverage
will decrease, the agency noted.
    United Technologies and its units face strong competition
but they all dominate their markets, Moody's pointed out.

<TITLE>YEUTTER CALLS TEXTILE BILL "PURE PROTECTIONISM"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said a textile bill, widely expected to be offered as
an amendment to trade legislation on the House or Senate floor,
is "pure protectionism."
    "Its attachment to a trade bill would kill the bipartisan,
cooperative spirit needed to produce growth-oriented,
market-opening legislation," he said in a speech prepared for
the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
    President Reagan vetoed that bill last year and would
almost certainly reject this year's bill, he added.
    "We simply cannot accept legislation that would provoke
retaliation against American exporters, destroy the Uruguay
Round, and embroil us in dozens of trade wars," the trade
representative said.

<TITLE>GAO FARM CREDIT PLAN SUPPORTED BY KEY LAWMAKER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>An influential member of Congress
endorsed a General Accounting Office, GAO, proposal calling for
establishing a federal board to oversee government assistance
to the financially-troubled farm credit system.
    Rep. Ed Jones, D-Tenn., chairman of the House Agriculture
subcommittee which will draft a farm credit rescue package
later this year, told reporters following testimony by
Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, that establishing a
federal board to implement the rescue is a good idea.
    "I like the idea of an additional layer of management" to
oversee the rescue, Jones told reporters.
    Rep. Jones made the remarks following a hearing at which
the General Accounting Office, GAO, outlined its suggestions
for a bail-out of the system.
    Comptroller General Bowsher proposed Congress set up a
strong board, modeled on the example of the successful Chrysler
loan guarantee board, to make hard choices on restructuring the
failing system.
    The members of the board would include both representatives
of government agencies and some independent officials, Bowsher
proposed.

<AUTHOR>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAO PAULO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil's financial crisis is rapidly
becoming a political and social crisis, and President Jose
Sarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future.
    As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the United
States this week, political analysts say Sarney's
administration has never appeared weaker.
    The full political price which Sarney will have to pay for
the failure of the much-vaunted anti-inflation Cruzado Plan is
still not clear. He might have to pay with the presidency.
    Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to
pick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of his
term will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney has
been lobbying for a six-year term.
    Sarney came to power, without facing presidential
elections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21
years of rule.
    Although there was wide public support for direct 
elections for president, the military as one of their last
acts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more
influence, make the choice.
    The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician who
headed the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), which
had opposed military rule.
    In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves chose
Sarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial
post of vice-president. But Neves died before he could take
office and Sarney took power.
    He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado
Plan was wildly popular with inflation-weary Brazilians.
    But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not
been the same.
    "The country is a rudderless ship," said a U.S. Diplomat,
echoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea
of how to tackle the economic crisis.
    Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism
coming from the business community, the trade unions, some of
the military, the media and political opponents.
    Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney's decision
announced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of foreign debt.
    A motor industry executive said: "The business community
thinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimes
harsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in
order."
    Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but
disagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the end
of February they have organized national strikes of seamen,
bankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local
stoppages and protests.
    Economic problems have prompted criticism from some
military figures, including the last army ruler, General Joao
Figueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost daily
military men deny there is going to be a coup.
    If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of
Sarney's fate will be the PMDB's leaders. So far, they have not
taken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.
    But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedly
said yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the
Consituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency
whenever it wished.
    In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism.
    One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of the
Jornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:
    "President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it
is just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state
of the country and the people since the immense failure of the
Cruzado Plan.
    "The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the
enticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too
profound."He called for direct elections early in 1988 as the
only way out of the present crisis.
    One of Sao Paulo's leading news magazines, Senhor, said in
an editorial this week: "The anarcho-populist government of
President Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already been
too long for such a disastrous experience.
    "It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. The
natural solution: direct elections soon."
    The government's inability to control inflation is now
bringing with it serious social problems.
    An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens of
thousands of families onto the streets because they can no
longer afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.
    The local press says the city is experiencing the biggest
wave of land invasions in its history.
   According to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pct
in little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost
2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as the
minimum wage, which is all that many earn.
    Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of Sao Paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of "a social
conflict of unimaginable proportions."
    With his back to the wall politically and with social
tensions rising, Sarney is no position to compromise on debt.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SETS UP SPECIAL DEBT COMMISSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazil has set up a special debt
commission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to be
responsible for renegotiating Brazil's 109 billion dollar
foreign debt, officials said.
    The principal negotiator on the commission, created by
President Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister Ramiro
Saraiva Guerreiro.
    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commission
by eight senior officials, including a representative of the
National Security Council.
    The creation of the commission is intended to underscore
the Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue is
essentially political and that a political solution must be
found to the problem.
    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68
billion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.
    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they are
equally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.
    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the U.S. for fresh debt
negotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia's
suspension of interest payments.

<TEXT>
<TITLE>DOLLAR ENDS WITH MODEST LOSSES IN NEW YORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar ended with modest net losses
against most major currencies as the market conducted a final
round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial Group of
Five and Group of Seven meetings, dealers said.
    "The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to see
if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then
take it from there," said one dealer at a top European bank.
    As a result, generally supportive comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.
    The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.
    However, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably
above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,
the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180
in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.
    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul
Volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially
catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.
    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be "large
enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal
restraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a
narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."
    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. "It
was the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as
a defender of the currency," said one trader.
    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long
conversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this
afternoon.
    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for
currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role
the U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to
prop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.
    "Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only
person who will make a difference is Baker," said Alan Rose of
First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.
    "The key question for the currency market is whether the
(Reagan) administration will have a change of view on the
dollar. If not, the dollar is going lower," he added.
    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen
was linked to the market's perception that Washington was
unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances
and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least
disruptive way of accelerating the process.
    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of
attitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh
positions until later in the week.
    "We are reserving judgement for the time being," said Doug
Madison of Commerzbank Ag.
    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling
trading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at
1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.
    However, underyling sentiment remains positive after a U.K.
opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest
popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.
    "Sterling still seems to be on the firm side," said one
dealer.
    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger
tone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from
1.3080/85 yesterday.
    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,
the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below
average market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct
yesterday.

extend until March 31, 1988 the date for the National
Commission on Dairy Policy to report on the federal milk price
support program and the dairy industry.
    The report is to recommend whether the Agriculture
Department should have continued authority to reduce the milk
price support level.
    The one year extension was required due to delays in
setting up the commission.

<TITLE>YEUTTER BLAMES OVERPRODUCTION FOR TRADE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Over-investment and over-production are
at the root of many of the difficult trade issues that have
soured relations between the United States and some of its
major trading partners, trade representative Clayton Yeutter
said.
    He told a conference, held by the University of Chicago's
Graduate Business School, that much of this was caused by
governments "getting their finger in the pot."
    Yeutter referred specifically to the problems of
agricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a point
of contention most notably between the United States and the
European Community.
    "Think of the vast waste of financial and other resources,"
he said.
    Yeutter said much of the problem underlying the dispute
with Japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.
    The trade representative called for a long-term approach to
international trade and said the recent commitment to a
free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada was a
step in the right direction.
    There's a lot of work to be done in the next six months,
but we have set October 1 as a target date for an agreement to
be reached, he added.
    "We're trying to create an environment that will facilitate
and foster free and open trade in the world," he said.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. trade reprepresentative Clayton Yeutter said
that if Congress were to require trade retaliation, it would
only close markets and would result in less trade.
    Many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly
protectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to close
off market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement is
unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several
years, he said in remarks prepared for an address to members of
the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
    CHICAGO - The rally in soybean prices may prompt farmers to
plant more soybean acres than the USDA projected in last week's
acreage report, especially if new crop futures stay above the
psychologically important 5.00 dlr a bushel mark, traders and
analysts said.
    NEW YORK - Magma Copper Co, a subsidiary of Newmont Mining
Corp, said it is lowering its copper cathode price by 0.50 cent
to 65.50 cents a lb, effective immediately.
    LONDON - Brazil is likely to adopt a conservative coffee
sales policy given the absence of International Coffee
Organization export quotas, at least until October this year,
according to the latest monthly coffee report from London trade
house E.D. and F. Man.
    LONDON - Delegates to this week's quarterly session of the
International Tin Council expect Indonesia to vote for an
extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement.
    HAVANA - Cuban president Fidel Castro told a congress of
the union of young communists here that the production of crude
sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes
behind schedule.
    In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paper
Granma, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously
interrupted harvesting and milling operations, especially in
the central and western parts of the island.

<TITLE>ITALY'S ENI TO INVEST IN VENEZUELAN PROJECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's state-owned Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi (ENI) will invest 197 mln dlrs in two joint
ventures in coal and petrochemicals with Petroleos de
Venezuela, S.A, ENI president Franco Reviglio said.
    Speaking at a news conference, Reviglio said the two
projects will eventually bring in some 300 mln dlrs annually in
foreign exchange to Venezuela and help diversify the country's
export base. "Joint ventures are the principal instrument for
allowing the resources of the industrialized countries to be
channeled to the developing world so as to lead future growth
for both," Reviglio said.
    ENI's subsidiary Ecofuel will join Pequiven, the
petrochemical subsidiary of PDVSA in building a 160 mln dlr
plant to produce mtbe, a gasoline additive used to increase
octane levels.
    The 500,000 mt per year plant will be constructed at Jose
in eastern Venezuela, and fed by butane produced at PDVSA's
eastern cryogenic complex. ENI owns 48 pct of the joint venture
company, Super Octanos, C.A., while Pequiven has 49 pct, with
the remaining three pct to be sold to private investors.
    Production is set to begin in third quarter 1989. Ecofuel
officials said the plant is modeled after one in Saudi Arabia.
    Another ENI subsidiary, Agip Carbone, will sign a letter of
intent in Caracas tomorrow to enter a partnership with PDVSA to
mine the coal deposits at guasare in western zulia state, he
said.
    Feasibility studies are still being done on the carbozulia
project, with a definitive accord slated for august, he added.
    Agip carbone and atlantic richfield coal, an arco
subsidiary have formed a consortium which will own 48 pct of
the carbozulia project, whose total cost is estimated at 500
mln dlrs, the company said. Agip carbone will invest 24 pct, or
120 mln dlrs, in the project, it said.

<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>RepublicBank Corp said it has placed
182.6 mln dlrs of all intermediate and term loans to Brazil on
a non-accrual basis as of March 31.
    It said the reclassification will reduce first quarter
earnings by 2.8 mln dlrs after taxes, and 11 mln dlrs after
taxes for all of 1987, if Brazil does not change its position
of a moratorium on interest payments.
    RepublicBank also said its net income for the first quarter
is expected to be about 10.4 mln dlrs or 30 cts a share on a
fully diluted basis. In the year-ago first quarter the company
earned 23.1 mln dlrs or 75 cts a share.
    The company also said its first quarter results are
expected to include a provision for loan losses of 55 mln dlrs,
about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln
dlrs. It said the provision will increase loan losses to about
328 mln dlrs or 2.2 pct of loans.

<TITLE>SUPPLIES, MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Petroleum futures rallied today in a
market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and
became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.
    Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching
life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17
cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.
    "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will
not remain there long if products are not strong," Robert
Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.
    Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the
American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic
inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.
    Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in
the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new
offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore
oil fields and an oil export depot.
    Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and
silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
    Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the
close with support from the silver market, which was
approaching two-year highs, traders said.
    Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.
    Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and
the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which
is limiting supplies.
    In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected
a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's
report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for
export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack
of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders
said.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.
    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many
farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather
than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales
have been lighter than expected this week.
    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but
prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as
speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.
    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength
related to tight supplies.
    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains
past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat
packers to bid aggressively for available animals.
    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after
the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract
soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start
of the year.
    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil
would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

<TITLE>U.S. STOCK INDEX FUTURES PLUMMET IN LATE TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. stock index futures dropped in 
active late afternoon trade and closed near daily lows.
    The selloff followed an early rally that had sent June S
and P 500s to a new contract high of 306.10. Arbitrage buy
programs were triggered when the June S and P reached a 3.20
point premium over the spot index, traders said.
    However, weakness in the bond market in afternoon trade
sparked selling in June S and Ps, sending the nearby contract
to a discount which triggered the unwinding of buy programs,
traders said. June S and Ps fell through chart support at
296.00 which also sparked technical selling.
    Value Line futures closed down 6.85 to 7.00, S and P 500
futures fell 7.65 to 7.85, NYSE futures dropped 4.60, and MMI
futures ended 10.65 to 11.00 points lower.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian bonds extended mild losses from
early activity to close up to 3/4 of a point lower in moderate
trading, dealers said.
    The decline reflected investor concern about economic
trends, coupled with the sharp afternoon downturn in U.S. bond
markets on firm oil prices and the uncertain outlook for the
U.S. dollar, traders said.
    The benchmark Canada 9-1/2 pct of 2001, off 1/8 in early
trading, closed behind 5/8 at 105-3/4 7/8, while the 8-1/2 pct
of 2011 lost 3/4 from last night to 96-5/8 7/8.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Posted county prices in 99 southern
Texas counties have been changed to reflect only one market
differential instead of the usual two-terminal market pricing
system, a senior Agriculture Department official said.
    Interior grain and soybean prices in the affected counties
will now be based solely against the Texas Gulf. Prior to the
change, county prices were also priced against the Amarillo
market.
    The changes were made to better reflect local market
conditions, said Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator for
commodity operations at USDA.
    "The Texas Gulf has always been the dominant market in those
counties. Amarillo never became effective for that area,"
Klopfenstein told Reuters.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKETS CLOSE SHARPLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Firm oil prices, a sharp stock price
fall and widespread fear that the dollar has much more room to
decline sent bond prices tumbling, dealers said.
    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1-3/32 points
to close at 95-1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basis
points from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.
    "Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seems
headed for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said.
That would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.
    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.
Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.
    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instability
of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central
bank support will not be able to prevent a further sharp
decline in the U.S. currency.
    The dollar came under mild downward pressure early and
finished with modest net losses. The currency was largely
unaffected by generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa.
    Miyazawa once again said he and Treasury Secretary James
Baker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the dollar's
fall thus far should be "large enough, in a context of a
growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S., to
support widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real
trade deficit in the period ahead."
    Despite favorable comments by Volcker and Miyazawa, there
appears to be broad agreement among currency and bond market
participants that a huge Federal budget deficit and a wide,
although narrowing, trade gap will further depress the dollar.
That could mean Japanese and other foreign investors will buy
fewer U.S. bonds or even start selling them.
    There has been no evidence of large-scale sales of U.S.
bonds by the Japanese. Some dealers said that these investors
actually purchased a modest amount of U.S. debt today, but they
focused on shorter maturities in the two-year area rather than
on long bonds.
    To the extent that overseas investors back away from the
U.S. bond market, dealers said that higher yields will be
needed to lure others to take their place.
    A late Federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to the
bond market retreat. After averaging 6.20 pct yesterday, funds
opened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between 6-1/16 and 6-1/4 pct.
    The Federal funds rate rise occurred despite the Fed's
unexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. The Fed
arranged two-day System repurchase agreements with funds
trading at 6-1/8 pct.
    Treasury bill rates increased largely in response to the
higher funds rate. Rates on new three and six-month bills rose
two and seven basis points from Monday's auction averages to
close at 5.55/54 pct and 5.70/69 pct. Year bills at 5.81/80 pct
were up eight basis points from yesterday's close.
    Among notes, the 6-3/8s of 1989 dropped 1/8 to 99-9/16,
with the 7-1/4s of 1996 down 3/4 at 97-3/8.

<TEXT>
<TITLE>DOLLAR ENDS WITH MODEST LOSSES IN NEW YORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar ended with modest net losses
against most major currencies as the market conducted a final
round of position-squaring ahead of tomorrow's crucial Group of
Five and Group of Seven meetings, dealers said.
    "The dollar was trendless today. People are waiting to see
if anything new comes from the meetings tomorrow and will then
take it from there," said one dealer at a top European bank.
    As a result, generally supportive comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa went largely unheeded.
    The dollar closed at 145.60/70 yen, down from 145.85/90.
    However, the dollar's yen closing level was comfortably
above its overseas low of just under 145 yen. Against the mark,
the dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180
in Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.
    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul
Volcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially
catastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.
    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be "large
enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal
restraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a
narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead."
    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. "It
was the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as
a defender of the currency," said one trader.
    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long
conversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this
afternoon.
    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for
currency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role
the U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to
prop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.
    "Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only
person who will make a difference is Baker," said Alan Rose of
First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.
    "The key question for the currency market is whether the
(Reagan) administration will have a change of view to the
dollar. If not, the dollar is going lower," he added.
    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen
was linked to the market's perception that Washington was
unhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances
and that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least
disruptive way of accelerating the process.
    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of
attitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh
positions until later in the week.
    "We are reserving judgement for the time being," said Doug
Madison of Commerzbank Ag.
    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling
trading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at
1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.
    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.
opinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest
popularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.
    "Sterling still seems to be on the firm side," said one
dealer.
    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger
tone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from
1.3080/85 yesterday.
    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,
the dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below
average market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct
yesterday.

    Yeutter was commenting on proposed changes in the law which
would transfer to the trade representative much of the current
retaliatory power held by the White House, which has been the
target of congressional dissatisfaction on trade issues.

<TITLE>YEUTTER CALLS TEXTILE BILL "PURE PROTECTIONISM"</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said a textile bill, widely expected to be offered as
an amendment to trade legislation on the House or Senate floor,
is "pure protectionism."
    "Its attachment to a trade bill would kill the bipartisan,
cooperative spirit needed to produce growth-oriented,
market-opening legislation," he said in a speech prepared for
the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
    President Reagan vetoed that bill last year and would
almost certainly reject this year's bill, he added.
    "We simply cannot accept legislation that would provoke
retaliation against American exporters, destroy the Uruguay
Round, and embroil us in dozens of trade wars," the trade
representative said.

<TITLE>YEUTTER BLAMES OVERPRODUCTION FOR TRADE PROBLEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Over-investment and over-production are
at the root of many of the difficult trade issues that have
soured relations between the United States and some of its
major trading partners, trade representative Clayton Yeutter
said.
    He told a conference, held by the University of Chicago's
Graduate Business School, that much of this was caused by
governments "getting their finger in the pot."
    Yeutter referred specifically to the problems of
agricultural trade, where subsidized exports have been a point
of contention most notably between the United States and the
European Community.
    "Think of the vast waste of financial and other resources,"
he said.
    Yeutter said much of the problem underlying the dispute
with Japan over semiconductors was due to overproduction.
    The trade representative called for a long-term approach to
international trade and said the recent commitment to a
free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada was a
step in the right direction.
    There's a lot of work to be done in the next six months,
but we have set October 1 as a target date for an agreement to
be reached, he added.
    "We're trying to create an environment that will facilitate
and foster free and open trade in the world," he said.

<TITLE>DOE RECOMMENDS SPECIAL UNIT TO ENRICH URANIUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary John Herrington told
Congress that a federally chartered corporation would be the
best way to manage and operate the government's uranium
enrichment program.
    He said in a letter to Congressmen that unless the program,
now run by the Energy Department, is improved, sales worth five
billion dlrs could be lost between 1990 and 2000.
    The program now has annual commercial sales of about one
billion dlrs and holds 50 pct of the free world market for
enrichment services.
    A department official said the world market for enriched
uranium for reactors for power utilities is increasingly
competitive and private entity could better tap it.
    The Administration's plan to spin off the department's 
uranium enrichment operation is in line with it effort to
reduce the federal government's role in areas where it feels
private enterprise could be more efficient.

<TITLE>U.S. CREDIT MARKETS CLOSE SHARPLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Oil price firmness, a sharp stock price
fall and widespread fear that the dollar has much more room to
decline sent bond prices tumbling, dealers said.
    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 fell 1-3/32 points
to close at 95-1/32 and a 7.94 pct yield that was up 10 basis
points from Monday and was 1987's highest closing yield.
    "Investors threw in the towel today. The long bond seems
headed for eight pct within the next few days," a trader said.
That would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.
    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.
Notes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.
    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instability
of the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central
bank support will not prevent a further drop in the dollar.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Allegheny International Inc, which has
agreed to a merge with a jointly-formed First Boston Inc
affiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs, said shareholders of its
preferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the
company.
    The complaint alleges, among other things, that the company
and its board agreed to pay First Boston an illegal seven mln
dlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company
prior to the buyout.
    The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability
to attract other offers or take other actions that would
benefit holders of preferred stock. The complaint also alleges
federal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary
duty.
    The suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the
pending offer being made by Sunter Acquisition to acquire
Allegheny. Sunter Acquisition Corp and Sunter Holdings Corp
were formed by First Boston and Allegheny.
    Allegheny said it and the Sunter concerns intend to
vigorously defend the complaint's charges.
    The complaints were filed by Robert Moss and other parties
who are believed to own about 230,000 shares of Allegheny's
preferred stock.

<TITLE>CANADIANS URGE EXEMPTION FROM U.S. TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of Canadian lawmakers from
Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada
from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major
trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress.
    At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, an
organization of U.S. legislators, David Cooke, chairman of the
Ontario Parliament's Select Committee on Economic Affairs, said
the exemption would help trade relations.
    The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in
late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would
harm the U.S. economy.
    Currently, Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any
grounds.
    Cooke, a member of the Liberal party, told the U.S.
congressmen, "I can understand (the trade bill). I think it has
to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world."
    "I would suggest to you that we are your best friends. You
do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely
consider exempting our country from that bill," he added.
    Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with
two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985, according to
the coalition. But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in
manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr
surplus in services trade with its neighbour.

<TITLE>TEXAS MAY CONSIDER INCOME TAX TO SOLVE BUDGET WOES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Elsworth, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DALLAS, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The State of Texas, faced with a record
5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may
have to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.
     Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when
the state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily
allowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate
income tax.
     However, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not only
sent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into
the state's tax revenues.
    Both Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's cut
their credit ratings of the state to double A from the top
triple A in early March.
    Moody's Vice President George W. Leung said it was the
first time Texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding
the report noted that while "the Legislature is now considering
proposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for
full recovery are weak."
    With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by State
Comptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapple
with a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8
billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No other
state in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.
    "There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five
years ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature
would institute an income tax," said George Bland, Assistant
Professor of Political Science at North Texas State University,
adding, "Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it's
coming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time."
     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally
supplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.
    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent
years, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence
on sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.
     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major
factor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are
no longer deductible from federal income tax while state income
tax is.
    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-based
Texas Research League said, "There is a great deal of popular
sentiment against it, plus the first plank of Governor
Clements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax."
    However, he said that since the oil price fall the state
faced a choice of either instituting an income tax or
broadening and possibly raising the sales tax.
    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterprise
at Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,
said he favored reforming the present tax system to take
account of the changed structure of the economy.
    "We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil
and agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,
manufacturing and high-tech," Pejovich said.
    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock
said, "Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the
Legislature that if they get tired of looking at everything
else, that's the only option."
    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual income
tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,
Washington and Wyoming 
    For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled
that the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr
deficit into the next biennium, even though the state
consitution requires a balanced budget. But as State Treasurer
Ann Richards said last Thursday, "Jim Mattox's decision today
turns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not
think that the goose isn't still cooking."
    Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending
cuts. But the state is already under pressure from a Federal
District Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or
face 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.
    And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accused
the state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier this
year, both houses of the Legislature, citing financial
restraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning
plans to require teachers to take competency tests.
    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission
next year to "study alternative revenue sources," with an
income tax being instituted as early as January 1989.
    "If the political leaders are educated about (the effects
of the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drift
toward income tax," he said.

<TITLE>SENATE REPORT - REAGAN PLANS EARLY SDI DEPLOYMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration is secretly
developing plans for an early deployment of President Reagan's
controversial "Star Wars" anti-missile system, according to a
Senate study.
    "Near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course for
America," said Sen. Bennett Johnston in a statement issued with
the report. "It would force us to break the bank, throw out the
ABM treaty and commit us to an arms race in space."
    The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debate
over the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as the land and
space-based anti-missile system is called, and may decide later
this month to reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to include
development and space testing.
    Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat William
Proxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accused
the administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as a
political ploy to commit the United States to strategic
defenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.
    "This report exposes the fact that without a presidential
directive or congressional consent, the SDI program ... is
being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic
defenses," Proxmire, chairman of the powerful Senate
Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, said.
    "In other words, they're covertly reorienting the SDI
program without congressional approval."

<TITLE>JAPAN SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PARIS CURRENCY ACCORD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Hisanobu Ohse, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan will seek to strengthen the
Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group
of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow, Japanese
officials said.
    However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified,
would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord,
which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in
February, to be strengthened.
    Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be
discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow,
the Japanese officials said.
    The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this
week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will
reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing 
the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said.
    Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early
in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates,
officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of
that discussion.
    The Japanese officials also declined to detail what
Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint
intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on
independent American intervention.
    The officials said such a money market action to stabilize
the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is
suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also
for the benefit of the United States as well.
    As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its
domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain
economic measures to the G-7, the officials said.
    However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the
Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today
because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by
the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which
started April one, the officials said.
    Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own
economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen
in additional spending.

<TITLE>MOODY'S SAYS LOWER RATINGS SHOW 1987 DOWNTREND</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said the
credit quality of corporate bond issuers continued to decline
in first quarter of 1987.
    Of all corporate ratings changes during the quarter, 66 pct
were downgrades compared with 55 pct during all of 1986.
    Moody's said downgrades led upgrades last quarter by two to
one. It downgraded 50 companies, affecting 61 billion dlrs of
debt and upgraded 25 companies, affecting 9 billion dlrs of
debt.
    It said more than half of the quarter's downgrades were in
the industrial sector, affecting 25 billion dlrs of debt.
    Moody's said that continued leveraged buyouts and
restructuring among small and medium-sized companies will
account for up to one-quarter of coporate debt downgrades.
    Worldwide competition and overcapacity will continue to
take its toll on industrial companies, Moody's added. It said
intensifying competition in an environment of slow economic
growth, Moody's predicts 2.5 pct worldwide growth in 1987, will
lower returns and margins for many multinational firms.
    Bank and finance company downgrades outpaced upgrades by 16
to 6 respectively. It said this trend will continue because of
Latin American debt problems.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR OPENS EASIER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Australian dollar opened easier at
0.7085/90 U.S. Dlrs but quickly breached the 0.7100 barrier in
early trade.
    Dealers said there was still strong support for the unit
and forecast it would test its recent highs after shrugging off
yesterday's selling pressure.
    They said the dollar was better equipped to hold its
current values as its U.S. Conterpart is significantly lower
than the last time these levels were tested.
    A trading range of 0.7080 to 0.7120 U.S. Dlrs is expected
today.
    In early Australian trade the US dollar was pegged at
1.8253/63 marks and 145.40/50 yen from its New York closes of
1.8270/80 and 145.60/70.
    Dealers said the market had become sceptical about the
resolve of the major trading nations to assist the U.S. Out of
its twin deficit problems.
    They forecast a quiet day for the currency.
    The Australian dollar was firmer on the crossrates in early
Australian trade at 1.2964 marks from 1.2918, 103.32 yen from
103.15, 1.0763 swiss francs from 1.0732, 1.2391 NZ dlrs from

<TITLE>HOUSE COMMITTEE SLASHES "STAR WARS" FUNDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Armed Services Committee
slashed President Reagan's funding request for the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), approving 1.7 billion dlrs less than
he had proposed for the anti-missile program.
    The committee, during its consideration of the 1988 defense
authorization bill, also cut by more than half Reagan's request
for a rail system for strategic missiles.
    The proposals must be adopted by the full House and Senate
before becoming law.
    The committee approved 3.5 billion dlrs for SDI, a land-
and space-based anti-missile defense program commonly known as
"Star Wars." The amount was 1.7 billion dlrs less than the
administration request of 5.2 billion dlrs.
    The Reagan administration has requested a total of 312
billion dlrs for defense in 1988, but congressional leaders
have said that will be cut as part of a budget-trimming effort
to reduce the huge federal deficit.
    In other action today, the committee approved 250 mln dlrs
for a rail system for inter-continental ballistic missiles, but
did not specify which missile system. Supporters have said
missiles on such a rail network would be less vulernable to
attack than those in fixed underground silos.
    The administration requested 590 mln dlrs specifically for
a rail-mobile system for the 10-warhead MX missile. But many
congressmen, including House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin,
a Wisconsin Democrat, favor a smaller mobile missile dubbed the
"Midgetman."

<TITLE>RUDING SAYS BANKS, DEBTORS SHOULD TAKE LEAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding
said there was a growing feeling in the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund that commercial banks and debtor
countries should take a greater lead in assembling new
financing packages.
    "The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put together
large packages like Mexico," Ruding told reporters in a briefing
on this week's semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.
    Ruding, who is also chairman of the IMF's policy-making
Interim Committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within the
two institutions.
    Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling the
institutions were being unduly pressured by the Reagan
administration, Ruding replied "we should not go in the
direction of politicisation of the two institutions."
    Ruding said "no country large or small should push in that
direction."  He said he expected commercial bank lending to
debtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace of
lending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any major
initiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in the
debt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debt
crisis itself.
    In other remarks, Ruding said many countries supported a
General Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expected
Bank president Barber Conable also to express his support.
    The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present.
    Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would support
the use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance but
would stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automatic
consultations if indicators were sharply out of line with
policy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggested
establishing "norms" or automatic triggers for consultations
among industrial states if policies deviate from plan.
    Currently the plan also has the support of France, the
Netherlands and Italy while Britain, Japan and West Germany are
all opposed.

<TITLE>CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G-5, G-7 MEETINGS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7
finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key
to the direction of currency futures at the International
Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond
the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial
analysts said.
    "If they (the finance ministers) give the market something
really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond
the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the
dollar," said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.
    On the other hand, "anything neutral would tend to be
bearish for the dollar," Mills said.
    Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the
Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the
dollar, nor will central bank intervention.
    "A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies
and sell the dollar," said one trader for a large retail firm
on the floor of the IMM.
    "If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking
to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level," he
said.
    Technically, most currency futures are poised for another
rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.
    Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high
on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June
sterling set a new contract high on Monday.
    "Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you
don't need much to get things rolling," Sloane said.
    In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane
recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range
between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle
on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.
    A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a
breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby
Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the
0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.
    Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials
between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed
dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds
only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.
    What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an
increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the
Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.
    Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near
the top of their long-term rally.
    "Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to
calm people," said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.
    The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European
currencies will trade, Horner said.
    But sterling futures may still make another run for new
highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the
positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections
and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June
British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.
    Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of
the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.
    The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar
between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152
yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's
range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June
contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.
    If such a range does emerge from the meetings, "we will
have one more rally in the yen," Horner said.

<TITLE>POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
economic growth.
    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
correct the trade deficit."
    He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
route.
    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
above-target money supply growth.
    He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
political constraints getting such measures through the upper
house of the West German parliament.
    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
demand at home.
    "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
obstacle to further growth," he said.
    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
because external factors, including low oil prices and
favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
over monetary policy.
    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
    "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
money supply. But we must be very careful," he said.
    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
the United States.
    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
rates had been underestimated.
    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
said.
    "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
part of our American colleagues," he said.
    But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
the dollar's value could overshoot.

<DATELINE>    WELLINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>New Zealand's unemployment rate was

<TITLE>DOLLAR OPENS EASIER IN TOKYO</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar opened easier against major
currencies on underlying negative sentiment, but is likely to
move marginally ahead of expected meetings of leading Finance
Ministers in Washington this week, dealers said.
    The dollar is expected to move between 145.00 and 145.60
yen today as operators avoid taking big positions, despite low
expectations from any Washington talks, dealers said. The
dollar's upward potential looks limited as selling interest
appears strong around 145.60 yen, they said.
    The dollar opened at 145.33 yen against 145.60/70 in New
York and 145.25 at the close here yesterday.
    The dollar opened at 1.8245/50 marks against 1.8270/80 in
New York. Sterling was unchanged from New York's 1.6175/85 dlr
finish.
    The market is generally sceptical about the outcome of any
G-5 or G-7 meeting in Washington and the dollar is likely to
come under selling pressure which could push it towards 140 yen
if no significant measures to stabilise currencies emerge,
dealers said.
    They said Japan is expected to try to strengthen the Paris
accord on currency stability, but added they expect
disagreement between Japan and other nations.
    Japanese officials travelling with Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa told Reuters the G-7 will meet today, but currency
target zones or reference ranges will not be discussed.
    The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly
after the opening at around 145.30 yen, when a medium-sized
trading house started to sell the dollar, dealers said.
    The dollar opened at 1.5140/47 Swiss francs against
1.5145/55 in New York.

dollars shortly after the opening at around 145.30 yen, dealers
said.
    The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house
sold dollars, putting pressure on the U.S. Currency, they said.
    The dollar was also supported by a major electrical
consumer goods company, which was a speculative dollar buyer at

<TITLE>U.S. DOLLAR OPENS LOWER IN HONG KONG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Dollar opened slightly lower
in moderately active trading as bearish sentiment persisted,
dealers said.
    They said the selling pressure was light ahead of expected
meetings of leading finance ministers in Washington this week.
Participants tended to keep their positions small and Bank of
Japan intervention shortly after Tokyo's opening at around
145.30 yen failed to have a strong impact on the market, they
said.
    The dollar opened at 1.8247/57 marks against New York's
1.8270/80 close and the 1.8205/15 finish here yesterday.
    The dollar opened at 145.40/50 yen but weakened to near
145.30 when the Bank of Japan intervened. It finished at
145.60/70 in New York and 145.15/20 here yesterday.
    Dealers said the dollar appeared to be holding comfortably
above the critical 145 yen level now as yesterday's attempt to
break that level failed for lack of momentum. But the markets
generally are not expecting much from the Washington talks
today, they added.
    The dollar is expected to stay within a tight range today
with considerable selling pressure at the 145.60 yen and 1.8270
mark levels, dealers said.
    Dealers said supportive remarks yesterday from Federal
Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa were ignored as players squared positions.
    Volcker told a Congressional committee the dollar's fall so
far should be "large enough ... To support widespread
expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the
period ahead."
    Miyazawa, after meeting Treasury Secretary James Baker,
said they agreed on the need for currency stabilization and
that he was satisfied with the role the U.S. Has played in
supporting the dollar since the February Paris accord.
    Sterling opened at 1.6182/92 dlrs against New York's
1.6175/85 close and the 1.6200/10 finish here yesterday.
    Dealers said sterling sentiment remains positive as the
ruling Conservative party maintained its lead in opinion polls.
But they said technical selling may depress it to 1.6150.
    The Hong Kong dollar opened at 7.8005/25 against its U.S.
Counterpart compared with yesterday's 7.8015/35 close.
    Local interest rates tended easier with overnight opening
at four 3-1/2 pct against yesterday's 4-1/2 four pct close.
    Asian dollar rates were steady with three months opening
unchanged at 6-1/2 3/8 pct.
    The dollar started at 1.5147/57 Swiss francs against New
York's 1.5145/55 close and the 1.5137/47 finish here yesterday,
and at 6.0690/0720 French francs against 6.0780/0810 and
6.0600/20.

<TITLE>SYDNEY FINANCIAL FUTURES OPEN MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A sharp overnight fall on Wall Street due
to profit taking and arbitrage related selling and a subsequent
local share market slump led to a steep drop in most share
price index contracts, dealers said.
    They said domestic credit futures were higher, however, in
response to lower yields in short term money markets as the
Australian dollar firmed and cash weakened.
    Comex-linked gold futures were higher as a result of rises
in bullion. International credit futures were steady in
extremely thin trade.
    June share price index futures opened lower at 1,730.0
against yesterday's 1,735.5 close in moderate trade. September
was slightly higher at 1,741.0 against 1,737.0 in thin trade.
About 950 lots changed hands.
    Dealers said the market, which seemed to lose its momentum
late yesterday, reacted badly to the 45 point drop in the Dow
Jones index. The all ordinaries index dropped 10.3 points to
1,743.7 at mid-morning with losses across the board.
    June 90 day bank bills rose to 85.23 from yesterday's 85.16
close. September rose to 85.32 from 85.25. About 3,054
contracts were traded.
    Physical yields eased to 15.40 pct from 15.50.
    June 10-year bond futures, the only month to trade, were
higher at 86.92 against yesterday's 86.87 finish. About 5,433
lots were exchanged.
    March 1997 paper was 13.09 pct, down from 13.11.
   June Comex-linked gold futures started strongly at 427.50
U.S. Dlrs an ounce, up from 426.20 in New York and yesterday's
close of 425.00. Only two lots were traded.
    June U.S. T-bonds started at 97.02, down from a Chicago
finish of 97.08 and a close of 97.27, with 20 lots traded. June
Eurodollars were steady with only five lots exchanged.

<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Interest rate futures opened
slightly lower on underlying weakness of the U.S. Dollar,
dealers said.
    Sentiment was also dampened by a firmer federal funds rate
and stable oil prices. Remarks by Federal Chairman Paul Volcker
and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on the need for
foreign exchange stability had little impact on the market,
they said.
    June eurodollar opened at 93.26 below Chicago's close of

<TITLE>SIMEX CURRENCY FUTURES EASE IN EARLY TRADING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Simex currency futures eased in early
dealings, after a higher opening in quiet and cautious trading,
dealers said.
    They said operators were unwilling to take large positions
ahead of the expected group of seven ministers meeting in
Washington today.
    Participants also were cautious because of persistent Bank
of Japan dollar buying intervention, with dollar supportive
comments by Federal Reserve chairman and Japan's Finance
Minister having little impact, dealers said.
    June mark eased to around 0.5500 dlrs from a 0.5510 opening
and Chicago's 0.00501 and yen to 0.006910 against 0.006920 and
0.006913. About 200 lots of mark and 65 lots of yen were
traded.
    June Sterling was indicated at 1.6075/85 dlrs against
Chicago's 1.6080 with no business seen in the first trading
hour.
    Speculative buying helped Nikkei Stock Average Index
futures to firm in early trading, after a lower opening
following weaker New York stock market. June firmed  to 22,920
from a 22,550 low and 22,895 here yesterday with about 400 lots
exchanged.
    Gold futures remained idle. REUTER

<TITLE>ASIAN DOLLAR DEPOSITS OPEN QUIETLY MIXED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SINGAPORE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Asian dollar deposit rates opened
narrowly mixed in quiet trading, dealers said.
    They said the market ignored dollar supportive comments by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance
Minsiter Kiichi Miyazawa.
    The U.S. Federal Reserve's addition of temporary reserves
via two-day system repurchase agreements when fed funds were
trading at 6-1/8 pct also had little effect on the market.
    Short-dates were unchanged to slightly higher underpinned
by a steady U.S. Fed funds rate.  Overnight was little changed
at 6-5/16 6-3/16 and week-fixed rose 1/16 point to 6-3/8 6-1/4.
    Dealers said most operators refrained from taking large
positions as they await more news from the expected currency
talks in Washington starting today.
    Among period rates, one month eased 1/16 point to 6-7/16
6-5/16 pct, three and six months were unchanged at 6-9/16
6-7/16 and 6-11/16 6-9/16 pct, respectively while one year
gaind 1/16 point to 6-7/8 6-3/4 pct.
    Asian dollar CD rates opened mixed in quiet trading. One
month slipped to 6.40/30 pct from 6.45/35 yesterday, three
months was steady at 6.55/45 pct but six months rose slightly
to 6.70/60 pct from 6.65/55.

<TITLE>YEN BOND FUTURES HIT RECORD HIGH IN EARLY TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yen bond futures prices hit record highs
in early trade in response to the early jump in the cash bond
market on speculative purchases by brokers, dealers said.
    Key June was 111.31 after hitting a record high earlier of
111.48, against an opening of 111.02. It closed at 110.68
yesterday. September was 110.10, below the earlier record of
110.15 and against a 109.40 close.
    The rally was triggered by a fall in short-term interest
rates and heavy broker speculation in expectation of more
end-investor purchases. But prices eased towards end-morning as
the cash bond market fell on profit taking, dealers said.
    The yen unconditional call rate was 3.5000 pct today, down
from 3.6250 pct yesterday.
    The Bank of Japan sold a total of 800 billion yen worth of
financial bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected
money market surplus of 1,300 billion yen due to allocation of
government revenues to local governments and public entities
and the return of bank notes.
    Dealers were divided about whether expectations of another
discount rate cut have been built into the market. Some dealers
said it is too early for the market to discount a rate cut and
projected a possible sudden market retreat.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN UNIONS LAUNCH NEW SOUTH WALES STRIKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian trade unions said they have
launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New
South Wales (NSW) to protest against new laws that would reduce
injury compensation payments.
    Union sources said talks with the state government broke
down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later
today in an attempt to find a compromise.
    Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's
most populous state were the first to be affected, and union
officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless
there is a quick settlement.
    The state government recently introduced a new workers'
compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured
workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary
ratification.
    NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers'
compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed
cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.
    Union officials said industrial action could spread to
other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp
cuts in workers' compensation.

situation," Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
    Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data
and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market
forces. "The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise
supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess
inventories since 1985 will take some time," he said.
    Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales
in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.
    He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to
forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week's
talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAV WORKERS MAY BE ANGERED BY LOST SUBSIDIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslav government plans to stop
subsidising loss-making firms will anger hundreds of thousands
of workers, Western diplomats said.
    The law, proposed by Prime Minister Branko Mikulic, goes
into effect on July 1 and aims to end a long-standing practice
of supporting unprofitable companies. Under the law, wage cuts
will be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing to
recover within a six-month grace period will face liquidation.
    The diplomats said Mikulic's attempt to create a market
economy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to those
accustomed to government subsidies.
    "It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if an
overdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects on
the system," a Western diplomat said.
    He said if the law was applied too strictly it would
probably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest.
    Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following the
introduction of a wage-freeze law, later amended to allow more
flexibility and some exemptions in what some political analysts
saw as a retreat by Mikulic.
    But with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade union
leaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take.
    The union leaders said workers thoughout the country are
already receiving salaries below limits set under existing law,
while others have received no wages at all this year because
their employers are unable to pay them.
    Workers also complain much of their income is taken in
local, state and federal taxes.
    Many others are losing their motivation to work and
confidence in government as they feel their decision-making
powers are being eroded, trade union officials said.
    Meanwhile, the official Tanjug news agency reported a paper
and cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republic
closed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given "temporary
leave."
    Tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24
years it had been in operation, and its closure was the result
of "economic necessity" rather than bankruptcy.

<TITLE>ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By William Kazer, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mounting trade friction between the
U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
damage, businessmen and officials said.
    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
their gain.
    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
new taxes.
    "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for
leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co Ltd </BODY></TEXT>

<TITLE>UAL UAL.N> PILOTS PROPOSE WAGE CUT TO FUND BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>The union representing 7,000 pilots at
United Airlines is proposing wage cuts of up to 25 pct to help
finance a 4.5 billion dlr employee buyout of the nation's
second largest air carrier.
    In a television link-up of 10,000 employees at 11 sites
nationwide, the Air Line Pilots Association unveiled details of
a planned employee stock ownership plan for United, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of UAL Inc.
    The proposed wage cuts would affect senior pilots the most,
although the other 53,000 workers employed by United would also
be asked to accept less pay.
    In addition, the union is asking its pilots to invest
one-third of the union pension fund's 1.1 billion dlrs in the
proposed employee-owned company.
    In an effort to get the rank and file to contribute five
pct of their earnings, United's 21-member master executive
council donated 150,000 dlrs in cash and committed 2.1 mln dlrs
in pension fund assets for acquisition of new preferred shares.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand
outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese
energy demand, ministry officials said.
    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
mln, they said.
    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy
supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power
in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27
pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and
liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
and semi-finished products.
    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
first quarter due to lower oil prices.
    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
billion baht from 56.6 billion.
    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.

<TITLE>INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)
prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB
sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall
in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree
crops, told Indonesian reporters.
    Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332
dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.
    Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite
making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it
could possibly increase its international market share.
    Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil
after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure
supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.
    Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary
shortage than to lose export markets.
    Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500
tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank
figures.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
each shift and then to walk off.
    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
container movements most affected, but has not stopped
altogether, they said.
    They said they could not say how long the disruption will
go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.

<TITLE>INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    JAKARTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is
likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian
Nainggolan said.
    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
decision on when to go ahead had been made.
    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
    "Several factors make us move cautiously," Nainggolan said.
"We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."
    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
exchange officials said.
    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
23, traders said.
    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
the exchange would help this.
    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
encourage participation.
    Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
    Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
locally, the latest exchange report said.
     Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905
tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.
     Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and
44 traders.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiations between mining
companies and the National Union of Mineworkers are foundering
and mines could face a May Day work stoppage, the Chamber of
Mines said.
    It said the union had called off talks on a specific issue,
the introduction of a Labour Day on May 1.
    The union refused a request to give advance notification of
the names of workers who would be working on May 1 rather than
taking the option of a paid holiday, the Chamber said.
    It said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to
plan their operations.
    "The union is adamant only employees who wish to work on
Labour Day should notify management," the Chamber said.
    "This raises the prospect that the mines will once again
face stay-away action on May 1 and that the employees who do
not work will once again forfeit pay."
    It said the union accepted all the proposals except giving
advance notification for May 1.
    It said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on May
1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for
working that day.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
spokesman said.
    Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
back securities pledged on May 6.
    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
today's allocation.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
liquidity in the banking system.
    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
range are possible, dealers said.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EXCESS MONEY HURTS THAI BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Vithoon Amorn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thailand's improving economy may have
helped its trade and finance position but it has also created
major problems for local banks, Thai and foreign bankers said.
    They said a 900 mln dlr saving from cheaper imported oil
and 19.7 pct export growth last year contributed to the
country's first current account surplus in 20 years.
    But the bright picture, together with a government program
to help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices, coincides
with sluggish investment by a private sector still feeling the
lingering effects of the 1984-86 recession.
    Thai banks have had growing surplus funds and difficulties
finding borrowers since the third quarter of 1986.
    Kunthon Narkprom, head of the budget and planning division
of Thai Farmers Bank Ltd, estimated excess liquidity in banks
peaked last month at 60 billion baht, three times what he
considered normal. Bank of Thailand figures show total deposits
in 1986 grew 12.7 pct to 627.7 billion baht, while lending rose
only 3.4 pct to 548.6 billion.
    The lending/deposit ratio, which measures bank loans as a
percentage of deposits, fell to 86.6 pct last month, the lowest
since the 1970s, after averaging 96.6 pct in 1985.
    Thai banks have cut lending and deposit rates a record six
times since January 1986, during which time the average minimum
loan rate fell to 11.5 pct from 15.5 and the gross one-year
fixed deposit rate to 7.25 pct from 11.
    Five banks announced last week they would cut their maximum
lending rates to small borrowers by one percentage point to 14
pct.
    Kunthon of Thai Farmers estimated banks now have a combined
80 billion baht unused overdraft line as many small and
medium-size companies delay borrowing in anticipation of more
cuts in interest rates.
    The record liquidity has seriously hurt the profits of
banks, which have been forced to invest idle funds in low-yield
government securities.
    Kunthon said the banks hold four to 10 billion baht in
short-term government bonds bought through the Bank of
Thailand's bond repurchase facility, double the normal amount.
    Thailand's 16 local commercial banks registered one of
their worst years in 1986, with overall profits falling over 30
pct after a 14 pct decline in 1985.
    Kunthon said profits should increase 10 pct this year as
the banks adjust to the new interest rate structure.
    Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice president of Siam
Commercial Bank Ltd, told reporters last week the liquidity
problem stems partly from the fact most loan demands come from
businesses seeking funds for small, labour-intensive projects.
    He said there are few large, capital-intensive projects and
many borrowers go offshore to meet their requirements.
    Somboon Chinsavananond, Thai Farmers' fund management
executive, said liquidity has been aggravated by the central
bank's policy of fixing a stable baht-dollar exchange rate
which permits Thai companies to import dollar-denominated funds
with a minimal risk of currency exchange losses.
    He said underlying bearishness towards the U.S. Dollar has
encouraged foreign borrowers who hope to pay less on loan
principal when their loans mature.
    Thai bankers said central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakul
last month rejected a request to increase a 10 pct withholding
tax on interest on foreign loans, a measure they said would
reduce foreign borrowings. The governor replied the bankers
should extend more loans to rural areas instead.
    Bankers said some Thai banks have offered credit-worthy
clients loans at near money market rates of seven to eight pct
in a bid to compete with foreign funds.
    A market analyst at Siam Commercial Bank said bank lending
at such rates amount to about 15 pct of all loans extended by
the industry.
    A foreign banker, who requested anonymity, said the
"segmented market approach" used by Thai banks for setting
different lending rates has caused dislocation of funds in the
financial sector, eroded bank profits and prevented banks from
taking a more logical move of further cutting interest rates.
    He said the liquidity problem gives the Bank of Thailand a
perfect opportunity to assert more control on the Thai money
market.
    The Bank of Thailand is taking "a step in the right
direction" by planning to float three billion baht in bonds to
mop up part of the surplus, he said, but he added the bank has
been lax in using its bond repurchase window as a tool to
absorb or inject liquidity into the market.
    William Wu, head of the Treasury Unit of Chase Manhattan
Bank N.A., Said the money market lacks the instruments to
absorb liquidity and avoid sharp interest rate fluctuations.
    He said the liquidity has fuelled the stock market's
strongest rally in seven years and Thailand should seize the
opportunity to develop the corporate bond market.

<TITLE>JAPANESE AUTOMAKERS TURN TO FOUR-WHEEL STEERING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Major Japanese automakers are gearing up
to equip sporty models with four-wheel steering, a feature that
could become standard on high-grade cars in the future,
automotive industry sources said.
    Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, they
said. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel
steering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a
model with the new steering will be out by mid-year. Mazda aims
to ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will
depend on initial consumer reaction.
    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated
four-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.
Toyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field
at a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will
use the system in the near future.
    Though major U.S. And European automakers have also
researched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are
waiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for
further improvements in safety and costs.
    Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into
parking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns. 
    Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve
safety. "At extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more
control," said one official. "On slippery surfaces or at high
speeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle."
    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Honda
engineer said: "This invention is not intended to improve
safety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily."
    Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to
turn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow
speeds but in the same direction at high speeds.
    Honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but the
direction of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the
front wheels. With Nissan's system the rear wheels move only
parallel to the front.
    Automakers say professional drivers who have tested the
four-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling.
    An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer said
four-wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it is
uncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or
profits. "All automakers are interested in something new," he
said. "If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want to
follow."
    The official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick
to sell cars. "It's a benefit of a secondary nature compared
with devices for fuel economy or emission control."
    General Motors Corp has developed a four-wheel steering
system, but is unlikely to market it within the next five
years, Y. Hojoh, engineer with the Japan branch of General
Motors Overseas Corp, said. GM must consider the costs to the
consumer, he added.
    The industry sources said the additional cost of the system
in Japan would probably make little difference to the consumer
as it would be added to already high-priced models.

<TITLE>JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
a senior ministry official said.
    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
its farm import market," he said.
    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
protect local farmers.
    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
beef accord next March 31.
    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
some one billion dlrs in new business.
    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
industrial sector.
    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will
remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation
and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110
mln stg.
    Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
will add some 690 mln stg to the system today.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Moon Ihlwan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
    He told a press conference the government planned to
increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
the surplus "at a proper level."
    But he said the government would not allow the won to
appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
    "Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
the surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.
    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
time.
    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
in Asia.
    "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
turning point for the Korean economy," Kim said.
    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
about 50 pct in 1986.
    "The government, however, does not want to accelerate
reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," he
said.
    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
particularly the United States.
    "We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
proper level," Kim said.

<TITLE>GERMAN ENGINEERING WAGE-ROUND TALKS BREAK DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NECKARWESTHEIM, West Germany, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Talks between
employers and unions in the West German engineering industry
over pay and working hours broke down without result late last
night, an official from the IG-Metall union said.
    IG-Metall, Western Europe's largest union, is reviving its
campaign for a 35-hour working week and is demanding a five pct
pay increase. Strikes for a 35-hour week in 1984 brought West
Germany's automobile industry virtually to a standstill.
    The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reduction
in working hours to 38.5 from 40.
    The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key North
Wuerttemberg/North Baden area, which generally sets the trend
for the rest of the country.
    IG-Metall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night,
blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. He
said they had been uncompromising on the question of the
shorter week.
    Hans-Peter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said any
plan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours was
unacceptable. 
    The employers have not made an official offer on cutting
the working week, but sources involved in the negotiations say
that they are working on the basis of a possible half-hour
reduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987
and of 1.5 pct in 1988.
    The Union will propose that the negotiations be officially
declared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.
    IG-Metall has said that cutting the working week will
create jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people are
unemployed. IG-Metall itself has about 2.5 mln members.
    IG-Metall has already been staging a series of "warning
strikes" to press home demands for the 35-hour week.
    Yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plants
for one to two hours, according to an IG-Metall statement.
    Among the strikers were 4,000 at a Daimler-Benz AG </BODY></TEXT>

    A DIW report added the general downturn in the economy
since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness
of firms to take on workers. It referred to a marked downturn
in the number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector.
    New orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly
fallen or stagnated in recent months, but data for February
finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.

<TITLE>SEOUL STOCK MARKET CONSOLIDATES ON STATE MEASURES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jo Yun-jeung, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The South Korean stock market seems to be
consolidating following government measures to cool its rapid
rise this year, domestic and foreign analysts said.
    The composite index hit a record 405.13 early last week,
nearly 50 pct up from the New Year when it stood at 264.82, but
plunged to a 383.48 close on April 3, the day after the
government intervened.
    Under the measures, industrial firms with bank loans worth
50 billion won or more must either offer new shares or issue
convertible bonds to repay the loans.
    Securities houses will have to sell shares they are holding
if the volume exceeds 40 pct of their paid-in capital. The
ceiling for investment trust firms was fixed at 50 pct.
    South Korean firms have traditionally preferred obtaining
low interest bank loans -- the current rate is 10 pct -- to
issuing bonds at a higher rate or floating share issues with
the attendant dividend pressures and launch expenses.
    The Seoul Stock Exchange, with 355 listed stocks, grew
explosively in the first three months of the year, building on
an already impressive 68.9 pct gain in 1986.
    Analysts now expect the market to pause temporarily and
then resume its upward movement, despite the indirect
government regulation.
    They said the continuous growth of the nation's gross
national product (GNP) and trade surplus, improved exports and
good performances by industrial firms all fuelled the boom.
    The trade surplus widened to 460 mln dlrs in March from 110
mln in February, while government economists expect GNP to grow
nine pct this year.
    Analysts said the deep slump in the real estate market also
increased liquidity in the stock market.
    "Many investors are still confident the market will not lose
its strength. It seems likely to pause for a while and then
rebound again," said Park Sin-bom, a director of Lucky
Securities Co.
    "There are more positive factors than negative. The market
is still buoyed by ample liquidity thanks to the economy's
strong performance."
    The stock market began to recover during Saturday's
half-day session with the index closing at 397.24 in active
trading on Monday, but closed lower on Tuesday at 390.24 on
turnover of 76 billion won.
    "I would say the market is flat for the time being.... It is
very prone to profit-taking after the sharp gains in the first
three months and the various government measures," a foreign
analyst said.
    "But the market will head up again after a rest because the
fundamentals are expected to rise and investors will be as
bullish as ever at the slightest sign of a market recovery."
    He added that the newly launched 30 mln dlr Korea Europe
Fund would have an impact on the South Korean stock market,
despite its small volume compared with the 5.72 trillion won of
listed capital on the Seoul exchange.
    Local dealers recommend blue chips and financial shares as
these stand to benefit most from continuing trade friction
between the United States and Japan and the rumoured
restructuring of local finance houses.
    Dealers also cite the shares of domestically oriented
firms, which are less vulnerable to the effects of the gradual
appreciation of the won.

<TITLE>JAPANESE ECONOMIC PACKAGE SEEN AS MAJOR CHANGE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The economic package unveiled yesterday by
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) marks the start of a
major shift away from the policies of the past, private
economists and government officials said.
    "A big step forward has been taken," said Industrial Bank of
Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi.
    The package, seen as a response to mounting overseas
pressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later this
year, plus increased imports.
    Although the measures must still gain the approval of the
Finance Ministry, economists said the government will find it
too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they
have gained domestic and overseas backing.
    "At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning a
corner," said Sumitomo Bank Ltd's chief economist Masahiko
Koido.
    For the past five years the government has adhered to a
tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit
financing bonds in 1990.
    To meet that goal, spending departments are required to
submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the
previous year and investment five pct below.
    Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDP's policy affairs
council, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990
fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it places
on public works spending.
    Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledge
that policy changes might be needed, including easing the
government's iron grip on spending.
    Economists said the government could meet its 1990 target
and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by taking
advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt.
Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tight
stance but some signs of change have appeared.
    "We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to
restore fiscal balance," a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
    He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals
simultaneously. These were reforming the government's fiscal
position and stimulating domestic demand.
    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, "In looking at the
current situation of the economy and the relationship between
Japan and the United States, we feel we have to place more
emphasis on stimulating demand."
    Economists predict battles within the government over the
coming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the
cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of
fiscal discipline.
    "The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in
the dike, it will lead to a flood," Industrial Bank's Taketomi
said.
    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in
place to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely
to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy.
    "This seems to mark the first step toward a more active
fiscal policy in response to requests from the international
community," he said.
    Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implements
the LDP's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the
1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,
His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary
budget of around 1,000 billion yen.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA STUDIES RESTRUCTURING FINANCIAL SECTOR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-je said
South Korea is studying various measures to reform what he
described as its underdeveloped bank and financial sector.
    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, told a news
conference the country's banks and finance houses had not
developed to keep pace with their industrial counterparts.
    He said two major factors had hampered the development of
the financial sector -- high inflation and heavy government
intervention in bank decision-making.
    He said in the past the government had pressed banks to
give soft loans to industry to boost economic growth.
    Kim said the government would now give top priority to
interest rate liberalisation. This could be achieved within
several years, though not within one year.
    He said liberalisation was possible because South Korea's
current account had turned from a deficit to a surplus, which
had brought in foreign funds and increased domestic savings.
    The current account recorded a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs
in 1986 after a deficit of 890 mln dlrs in 1985.
    But Kim said the government needed to reorganise much of
the financial sector.
    Kim said mergers of some financial companies and the
upgrading of others to merchant banks or full banks were being
considered by the financial development committee of the
finance ministry. He did not elaborate but said he expected no
drastic measures to be announced this year.
    On liberalisation of the country's stock market, Kim said
despite Seoul's determination to open it up, free investments
there by foreigners would not be allowed in the near future
because the market was currently "over-heated." He said this was
due to ample liquidity created partly by the country's current
account surplus.
    Kim said the market was extremely vulnerable to a sudden
influx of foreign funds because it was still very small in
terms of size and numbers of shareholders.
    "Opening up the capital market must wait until the
vulnerability to such an influx is removed," he said.
    He said only about one mln South Koreans, out of a
population of 40 mln, invest in the Seoul market.

<TITLE>JAPAN GIVEN LITTLE HOPE OF AVOIDING U.S. SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A top U.S. Official said Japan has little
chance of convincing the U.S. To drop threatened trade
sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for
Washington today.
    Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves
to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could
persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports
said, and replied: "...It is probably too early for the figures
to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to
permit the result you have described."
    Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift
its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove
barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.
    "There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,
but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from
important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on
security and political issues," he said.
    "The question is whether through cooperative actions between
our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether
Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist
legislation," he said.

tonnes in March from 1,764 in February and 3,008 in March 1986,
the Mineral Resources Department said.
    A spokesman for Padaeng Industry Co Ltd, the country's sole
exporter, attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks,
which averaged 5,000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16,000
tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting.
    The department said major buyers included China, Japan, the
Philippines, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.
    Thailand exported 4,842 tonnes of zinc ingots during the
first quarter, down from 14,937 a year ago.

<TITLE>DUTCH PROPOSE STRICT INSIDER TRADING LAW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ministries of Finance and Justice
said they have presented parliament with a new law to make
insider trading in shares a criminal offence.
    A year ago, the Amsterdam Bourse announced its own rules,
effective from January 1, 1987, aimed at preventing unfair use
of inside information in the trading shares listed on the
exchange, but said back-up legislation was essential.
    The proposed law calls for up to two years imprisonment,
fines of up to 100,000 guilders for an individual and one
million guilders for a company, and repayment to the state of
profits made from insider dealing.
    The proposed fines are higher than any currently in force
in Dutch law, a joint statement from the two ministries said.
    The draft law sets no limit to the illegal profits to be
repaid. The amount would be determined by a court.
    A Finance Ministry spokesman said the time-frame for the
introduction of the new legislation depended entirely on its
reception in Parliament.
    In the meantime the Bourse's Share Trading Association
monitors business closely, frequently suspending or even
rescinding dealings in a stock when price movements suggest
that foreknowledge of a pending announcement is being
exploited.

(EC) white sugar tender is extremely difficult to predict after
last week's substantial award of 102,350 tonnes at the highest

    Some said they believed the tonnage would probably be
smaller, at around 60,000 tonnes, but declined to give a view
on the likely restitution. Last week, the European Commission
accepted 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention by operators
protesting about low rebates. This might be a determining
factor in today's result, they added.

<DATELINE>    HONG KONG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The People's Construction Bank of
China is launching its first international borrowing by
mandating four foreign banks for a 150 mln U.S. Dlr loan, one
of the lead managers Banque Indosuez said.
    The other three lead managers are Bank of Tokyo, Citicorp
International Ltd and the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The 10 year loan has a 4-1/2 year grace period. Interest is
set at 1/8 percentage point over London interbank offered rate
for the first eight years, rising to 1/4 pct for the remaining
two years. There is a 3/16 pct management fee and an
unspecified, but very small, commitment fee.
    Syndication of the loan is expected to start soon and it
should be signed in Shanghai next month.
    The Construction Bank, which is one of four specialist
banks in China, focuses on infrastructure and heavy industrial
projects.
    The funds raised will partly finance two ethylene factories
near Shanghai. Construction of the plants, which are a major
item in the current five year plan, will begin soon.
    The plants will cost more than 300 mln dlrs. The remainder
of the funds will come from export credits and domestic
borrowings.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian markets are booming as foreign
fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and
other traditional markets, analysts said.
    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and
an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of
fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and
U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.
    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in
and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they
diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.
    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in
the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the
currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
inquiries from Japan and the United States.
    "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending
up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
reasonable currency stability," National Australia Bank Ltd
economist Brian Hamley said.
    "There is a 'flight to quality'," Hamley said. "Australia may
not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
many other countries where you'd want to put your money."
    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting
investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
    "We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.
Where some people would be concerned about the value of the
U.S. Dollar," Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose
said. "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap
and the currency looks stable?"
    But turning that capital into more permanent productive
investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
    "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
direction in the economy," Buttrose said, adding that offshore
investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
economic statement on May 14.
    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were
badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar
and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
    "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be
delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
might see a substantial outflow," Buttrose said.
    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough
economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
    "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think
they would like to leave the money here," Buttrose said.
    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased
interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield
Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an
element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
policy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off
the yen" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked
successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar
within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the
Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other
markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
equities, particularly in the gold sector.
    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
same period.
    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese
companies that have invested heavily in the United States in
recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
estate, particularly in the tourism field.
    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star
Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
as indicative of the type of property being sought.
    "They think they find good value real estate here which,
with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
investment Australia needs," Buttrose added.

<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden
economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices
will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists
say.
    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold
oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the
northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.
    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross
domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year
after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
    This was after taking into account inflation in consumer
prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
    Factors depressing economic activity include the
6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which
threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the
Gulf and has sapped business confidence.
    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September
when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis
caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive
new debt settlement program was introduced.
    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward
trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer
spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are
still owed by individuals and companies.
    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)
in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which
one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as
bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it
will not allow any banks to go under.
    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of
problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether
debtors have regular cash flows or not.
    Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights
guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance
in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector
is the biggest after oil.
    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride
out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)
compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last
year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.
    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in
Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at
home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell
over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average
2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed
product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as
crude.
    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason
for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic
inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent
years and signs government spending on productive sectors will
remain steady.
    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8
billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below
that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit
Gulf.
    Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put
officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income
of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these
reserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for
the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.
    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,
revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,
doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded
in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at
up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some
shortfall.
    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for
economic growth this year or next.
    "It depends on oil prices," one said. "This summer is
important."
    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday
the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state
spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the
economy.
    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be
spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

<TITLE>MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Malaysia is unlikely to meet its
targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar
1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.
    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,
unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser
and overstressed palms, they said.
    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World
newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to
drop sharply this year.
    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about
115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more
palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the
industry, a leading grower told Reuters.
    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes
against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.
    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year
due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.
    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,
is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous
21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.
    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected
to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil
output peaks.
    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,
with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees
against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction
will not be felt for about another three years.

<TITLE>BANK OF JAPAN HAS NO COMMENT ON YEN BOND REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Bank of Japan spokesman declined to
comment on a press report that the central bank had decided to
conduct closer scrutiny of the operations of financial
institutions in the bond market.
    The JIJI Press news agency had quoted Bank of Japan sources
as telling Japanese reporters the bank was deeply concerned
over potential risk in yen bond trading because the market had
risen too fast.
    However, JIJI quoted the sources as saying, the central
bank would not take such actions as guiding interest rates
higher.
    JIJI quoted the sources as saying that current bond market
yields are similar to short-term interest rates due to
excessive speculative operations.
    This was attributable to heavy redemptions of government
bonds and unclear prospects for the dollar, which has sent many
foreign bond market participants to the domestic market, the
sources were quoted as saying.

<TITLE>JAPANESE OFFICIAL TAKES DATA TO MICROCHIP TALKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves for
Washington today with data he hopes will refute U.S. Charges
Japan has violated a pact on microchip trade.
    A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington
laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S.
Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.
    But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. "I have
nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current
situation," Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
    Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data
and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market
forces. "The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise
supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess
inventories since 1985 will take some time," he said.
    Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales
in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.
    He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to
forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week's
talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.

<TITLE>NORWAY TO TIGHTEN RULES FOR REGISTERING LOANS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OSLO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Norway will from June require finance
institutions and insurance companies to report lending volume
to the central bank once a month rather than quarterly in a bid
to tighten domestic lending, Finance Ministry officials said.
    Norwegian Bank Association President Trond Reinertsen told
Reuters the new rule would make it more difficult for banks to
transfer funds to financial and insurance companies for
lending.
    Banks have in the past used the two month lapse in loan
registration to transfer money for lending to finance and
insurance groups to avoid penalty reserve requirements for
lending in excess of government set ceilings.
    The new rule brings loan reporting requirements for
insurance and finance companies in line with those already
applied to commercial banks, Ministry officials said.
    Borrowers have increasingly sought loans from finance and
insurance companies after the central bank last year clamped
down on what it called excessive bank lending.
    Bank lending dropped by five billion crowns in January from
260 billion crowns the previous month in response to the
stricter penalty reserve requirements, Oslo bankers said.
    They said recent central bank cuts in the overnight rate it
charges banks might offset new pressure on interest rates.

<TITLE>S. AFRICA MINES BODY SEES MAY DAY WORK STOPPAGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Negotiations between mining
companies and the National Union of Mineworkers are foundering
and mines could face a May Day work stoppage, the Chamber of
Mines said.
    It said the union had called off talks on a specific issue,
the introduction of a Labour Day on May 1.
    The union refused a request to give advance notification of
the names of workers who would be working on May 1 rather than
taking the option of a paid holiday, the Chamber said.
    It said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to
plan their operations.
    "The union is adamant only employees who wish to work on
Labour Day should notify management," the Chamber said.
    "This raises the prospect that the mines will once again
face stay-away action on May 1 and that the employees who do
not work will once again forfeit pay."
    It said the union accepted all the proposals except giving
advance notification for May 1.
    It said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on May
1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for
working that day.

<TITLE>JAPAN GIVEN LITTLE HOPE OF AVOIDING U.S. SANCTIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A top U.S. Official said Japan has little
chance of persuading the U.S. to drop threatened trade
sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for
Washington today.
    Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs, was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves
to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could
persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports
said, and replied: "...It is probably too early for the figures
to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to
permit the result you have described."
    Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift
its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove
barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.
    "There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,
but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from
important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on
security and political issues," he said.
    "The question is whether through cooperative actions between
our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether
Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist
legislation," he said.

    The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house

<TITLE>MOSCOW INDIGNANT AT REAGAN STATEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOSCOW, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir
Petrovsky said today Moscow felt "indignation and regret" at what
he called "truly hostile statements about the Soviet Union" made
by President Reagan.
    Reagan told reporters yesterday he was ordering a
high-level review of security at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
following a sex-and-spy scandal there and said Soviet diplomats
would not be allowed to use a new embassy in Washington until
the U.S. Moscow mission was made secure.
    Petrovsky told reporters it was not accidental that
Washington had chosen this time, only a week before a scheduled
Moscow visit by U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, to make
accusations against the Soviet Union.
    Objective conditions existed for improving Soviet-U.S.
Relations. "But it seems that someone in Washington fails to
appreciate this process and tries to poison the atmosphere," he
said.

<DATELINE>    JOHANNESBURG, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>South Africa's economic recovery
has broadened as favourable terms of a three-year foreign debt
rescheduling accord have given confidence to local business,
Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd said.
    The major life assurance company said in its first quarter
review that economic activity improved in 1986 with car and
retail sales clearly rising, adding that South Africa's
economic future had "brightened considerably."
    Liberty said pre-conditions existed for further growth in
1987 despite longer term structural problems.
    Short-term interest rates were unlikely to rise markedly in
the near future and unemployment levels were stabilising, the
company said.
    But the report cautioned that South Africa's economy still
faced high inflation and "extremely fragile" consumer and
business confidence which could be upset by political events.
    It also predicted the rand was likely to remain basically a
weak currency despite its nine pct rise in the first quarter to
49.55 U.S. Cts. REUTER

<TITLE>RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Good rains of one to four inches in the
past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
season.
    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
    Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
    Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
towards the end of May, he said.
    The cane crush normally runs from June to December.

    Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender

They said they believed the tonnage would be around 60,000 but
declined to give a rebate figure.

<TITLE>NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Nickel prices are unlikely to rise
significantly from current levels unless further steps are
taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in
its quarterly nickel market report.
    The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb
yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,
due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but
Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's
buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.
    Output reductions by producers will take effect later this
year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.
    Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in
balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at
556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in
1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from
Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).
    It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a
first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the
last quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb
compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange
cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987
sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.

<TEXT>
<TITLE>POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
economic growth.
    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
correct the trade deficit."
    He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
route.
    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
above-target money supply growth.
    He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
political constraints getting such measures through the upper
house of the West German parliament.
    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
demand at home.
    "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
obstacle to further growth," he said.
    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
because external factors, including low oil prices and
favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
over monetary policy.
    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
    "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
money supply. But we must be very careful," he said.
    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
the United States.
    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
rates had been underestimated.
    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
said.
    "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
part of our American colleagues," he said.
    But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
the dollar's value could overshoot.

<DATELINE>    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>California Biotechnology
Inc said it expects to report a loss of 1,300,000 dlrs to
1,600,000 dlrs for the first quarter due to increased
investment in research and manufacturing and a scaleup of
production.
    The company said research spending is running 50 to 60 pct
above a year ago as it tries to commercialize its products as
quickly as possible, and increased expenditures are expected to
continue for several more quarters.  It said operating results
will fluctuate quarter to quarter, depending on the timing of
significant payments from commercial partners.
    In the first three months of 1986, the company lost 150,000
dlrs.  The company changed its fiscal year in 1986 to a
calendar year from a year ending November 30.  For the first
quarter of last year, ended February 28, California Biotech
earned 114,000 dlrs.

<TITLE>JAPAN DIVISION OF LABOUR WITH ASIA URGED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan should promote division of labour
with its Asian neighbours, especially the newly industrialized
countries, to help achieve more balanced world economic growth,
the Bank of Japan said in a report.
    Instead of trying to produce everything by itself, Japan
should open up its market further to imports, transfer
manufacturing facilities abroad and increase technology
transfer with those nations, the bank said in its monthly
report.
    Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as mere
competitors in its overseas and domestic markets but as
countries that can contribute to the region's prosperity.
    The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asian
neighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning that
Japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports
manufactured goods to them.
    But this has resulted in an increase in their trade
deficits with Japan while some newly industrialized Asian
nations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries like
the United States.

<DATELINE>    GABORONE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Quett Masire appealed for
international aid to combat the effects of a drought ravaging
land-locked Botswana for the sixth consecutive year.
    Speaking on state radio, Masire said the drought had
decimated herds of cattle and wiped out crops throughout the
mainly desert country, which would be forced to rely on South
Africa for most of its food supplies in the coming year.
    Masire said the government would also be forced to continue
a drought relief program until at least the end of 1988 to
provide emergency water supplies and supplementary food to
vulnerable sections of the population.
    "It is against this background that we appeal to the
international community for assistance," Masire said.
    He thanked foreign governments for previous assistance, but
added, "The needs of the people in rural areas are greater now,
not less. We must prevent the human suffering caused by
malnutrition."

<TITLE>CALIFORNIA MOVES AGAINST KMG MAIN HURDMAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>California regulators said they
were seeking disciplinary action against the accounting firm
KMG Main Hurdman as the result of a 1985 audit of Technical
Equities Corp., an investment firm that filed for bankruptcy
last year.
    A spokeswoman for the California Board of Accountancy,
which certifies public accountants and firms in the state, said
a six-page complaint was filed against the New York-based
accounting firm.
    "We basically charged that the Technical Equities audit was
not conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards," Della Bousquet, executive officer for the board,
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    She said a hearing would probably be held before an
administrative law judge within three months. Penalties could
range from censure to revocation of KMG Main Hurdman's license
to do business in California.
    KMG Main Hurdman merged last week with Peat Marwick
Mitchell of New York to become the world's largest accounting
firm.
    The San Francisco office of the firm declined to comment on
the board's allegations.
    Bousquet said the company, among other things, was accused
of not properly investigating financial transactions and of
issuing a favorable opinion in August 1985 that relied on
misrepresentations of Technical Equities management.
    She said the accounting firm, although it knew Technical
Equities had severe cash flow and liquidity problems, was
accused of not performing a proper audit of it.
    The complaint named four individuals, including two
partners and two audit managers.
    Technical Equities, based in San Jose, filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in February 1986,
listing debts of 69.7 mln dlrs to 1,068 investors.
    Many of the investors were prominent sports and
broadcasting figures.

the Gulf war southern front today but Iraq said all were
repulsed with heavy loss of life.
    The Iranian news agency IRNA said Iranian troops inflicted
severe losses on Iraqi troops and military equipment on the
second day of a new offensive east of Iraq's city of Basra.
    "A number of tanks and personnel carriers were seized intact
which were used against the enemy in the operational theatre,"
IRNA said.
    The Iraqi news agency INA said Iraqi forces beat back the
latest Iranian thrusts.
    Baghdad said earlier that the Iranians had gained "footholds"
on Iraqi territory after launching the offensive on three
fronts near Basra.
    IRNA said yesterday the Iranians overran the headquarters
of two Iraqi brigades west of Fish Canal, a defensive line
about 10 km from Basra.

    A report by the organisation's Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) said German aid levels had shown only a
moderate increase in real terms in recent years, adding that
there was a risk that growth over the next few years might slow
further.
    German aid, estimated at around four billion dlrs in 1986,
represents 0.46 pct of the country's GNP. This is above the
DAC's average of 0.36 pct, but might decline if corrective
measures were not taken, the report said.

<TITLE>ASEAN SHOWS MIXED PERFORMANCE IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BANGKOK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A sharp oil price decline and sharp
fluctuations of exchange and interest rates in 1986 produced a
mixed economic performance by the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), a United Nations study said.
    The annual report of the U.N. Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said the
international economic environment reversed the fortunes of the
trade-oriented economies of the six ASEAN member countries.
    It said the already low 1985 growth rates of ASEAN's oil
exporting countries -- Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia --
dropped further after the oil price fall.
    Three oil importers -- Singapore, the Philippines and
Thailand -- improved their performance mainly by restructuring
their economies. But the report said the oil price fall reduced
export earnings, worsening economic prospects for the
exporters.
    The exporters' non-oil commodity prices did not show major
improvement and protectionist pressures from industrial
countries restricted export of manufactured products, it said.
    The GDPs of Indonesia, which was 1.9 pct in 1985, and
Malaysia, which fell a real one pct, barely grew in 1986.
    The two countries, buffeted by unfavourable external
factors in the past few years, were forced to curb aggregate
domestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balance
of payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercial
borrowings.
    The U.N. Body said the economic outlooks of Singapore,
Thailand and the Philippines improved steadily in 1986 as the
year advanced. It said the most favourable factor benefiting
the three was the realignment of key currencies, especially the
appreciation of the yen, which has resulted in the increased
competitiveness of their exports against those from Japan.
    The report said the downward spiral plaguing the Philippine
economy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct GDP
growth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becoming
growth sectors.
    It said the resumption of the Philippines' sustained growth
rests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem.
    ESCAP said the yen appreciation, together with economic
restructuring measures, played a big role in helping Singapore
recover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct GDP decline in
1985.
    It said the Singapore GDP achieved a growth of over one pct
last year after registering positive growth from the second
quarter.
    The Singapore economic revival was hampered by its own
adjustment measures especially its two-year wage freeze
enforced last April, a glut of its property market and
depressed conditions in its ASEAN neighbours which hurt
Singapore because they take about a quarter of its total
exports.
    The report said Thailand benefited from the changing world
economic environment far more than any of its ASEAN neighbours.
    The Thai performance stemmed from the expansion o</BODY></TEXT>

<TITLE>BRITAIN, JAPAN CLASH OVER STOCK MARKET ACCESS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain and Japan clashed today over U.K.
Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as
trade tensions between the two countries mounted.
    British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard told
reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response to
Britain's non-negotiable timetable for increased British
membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.
    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE)
head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchange
access, as "very frank indeed."
    In a separate press conference, TSE President Michio
Takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise
its membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.
    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms to
be named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of this
year. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.
    "Next May is the earliest possible date for opening our
membership and I want the British government to understand
this," Takeuchi said.
    Membership cannot be increased before space on the trading
floor is expanded in May 1988, he said.
     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and said
that Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financial
institutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.
    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from
the two countries in May or June to come up with a postive
response to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.
    "The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very
reasonable request and I expect it to be met," he said.
    Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floor
space to expand membership, Howard replied, "We find it very
difficult in our country to understand why the considerable
ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in world
markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind."
    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration with
the huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handling
of demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater role
in Japan's telecommunications business.
    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some of
that message may have penetrated.
    According to several reports, the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wireless
proposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the U.S.
    Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.

<TITLE>TOP FRENCH BANKER SEES CHINA FOREIGN DEBT VERY LOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PEKING, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>China's foreign debt is very low given
its export capability, the size of its economy and its growth
potential and the country is politically stable, Jean-Maxime
Leveque, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, told reporters.
    Leveque, who has met the heads of most of China's banks
including the president of its central bank during a visit
here, said the Chinese authorities are very attentive to its
foreign debt and have the matter under control.
    Official figures show China's foreign debt at a post-1949
record 16 billion dlrs at end-1986.
    Asked if he had advised China to borrow more francs and
U.S. Dollars and less yen, Leveque said he had not offered any
advice, but added: "The yen and the dollar are not stable, but
the ECU is stable."
    Asked if his bank has lost any confidence in China after
the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January,
he said: "We have total confidence in the political stability in
China. The policies of the open door and economic development
outlined in 1979 will not change, although there may be
fluctuations in speed."

<TITLE>JAPAN'S LDP URGES MORE IMPORTS OF 12 FARM ITEMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
has proposed expanding imports of 12 farm products named in a
U.S. Complaint against Japan to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade last year, an LDP official said.
    The products include fruit juices, purees and pulp, some
tomato products, peanuts, prepared beef products and beans.
    The proposal will be used as the basis for a more detailed
LDP economic package to cut the trade surplus with the U.S. The
party is expected to formalise the package before April 19,
when LDP General Council Chairman Shintaro Abe visits
Washington.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIAN UNIONS LAUNCH NEW SOUTH WALES STRIKES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australian trade unions said they have
launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New
South Wales, NSW, to protest against new laws that would reduce
injury compensation payments.
    Union sources said talks with the state government broke
down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later
today in an attempt to find a compromise.
    Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's
most populous state were the first to be affected, and union
officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless
there is a quick settlement.
    The state government recently introduced a new workers'
compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured
workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary
ratification.
    NSW state premier Barrie Unsworth has said workers'
compensation has risen steeply in recent years and the proposed
cuts would save hundreds of mlns of dollars a year.
    Union officials said industrial action could spread to
other states as the federal government also plans to make sharp
cuts in workers' compensation.

<TITLE>TANZANIA RAISES PRICES TO KEEP BUDGET DEFICIT DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Tanzanian government raised
the price of beer, soft drinks and cigarettes by 20 pct and
telephone and telex calls by 10 pct in an attempt to keep its
budget deficit for this financial year roughly on target.
    The deficit for the financial year ending on June 30 was
initially forecast at 3,350 mln shillings and the new measures
will raise some 700 mln shillings in extra revenue, a statement
from the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs and Planning
said.
    According to the statement, the price increases, which take
immediate effect, were needed because the government had lost
tax revenue through lower than expected industrial production.
Water and power problems and a shortage of spare parts had
reduced the output of Tanzanian factories, it said.
    The ministry also announced a new 30 pct tax on goods
imported by non-resident businessmen and said the government
would take steps against importers who have been evading duty
in collusion with corrupt customs officials.

<DATELINE>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.

<TITLE>INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN FOR DUTCH CARGO DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The two sides in the Rotterdam port
general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent
chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,
employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.
    Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of
Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an
agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
    Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in
protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
4,000-strong workforce this year.
    The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on
March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction
against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
    The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but
Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the
employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the
complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
    Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement
in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance
workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a
spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the
sector, said.
    The employers have written to the union asking it to
reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been
called for tomorrow.

<TITLE>COMPAQ CPQ> EXPECTS HIGHER FIRST QUARTER NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Compaq Computer Corp said it expects
sales and earnings for the first quarter of 1987 to be higher
than analysts expectations due to strong demand for its
products.
    Rod Canion, president and chief executive officer of
Compaq, said he expects sales of over 200 mln dlrs for the
period ending March 31, above analysts' estimates of 165-185
mln dlrs. He added that earnings per share would exceed
analysts estimates of as high as 42 cts a share.
    Compaq reported earnings of 8.3 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a
share, and sales of 144 mln dlrs for the first quarter 1986.
    The company said demand for its DESKPRO 386, PORTABLE III
and the new COMPAQ DESKPRO 286 will contribute to the sales
increase.
    "The initial demand for the recently introduced COMPAQ
PORTABLE III and the new models of the COMPAQ DESKPRO 286
exceeds that of any other Compaq personal computers," Canion
said. "We saw continued demand for our personal computers
across the quarter, with March (1987) being a particularly
strong month.

handed in their resignation from the five-party government in
which they are senior partners, Deputy Prime Minister Arnaldo
Forlani said.
    Forlani, president of the party, said he had handed a
letter of resignation by the Christian Democrats, who make up
more than half the 30 member cabinet, to the office of Prime
Minister Bettino Craxi.
    Political sources said the withdrawal of the Christian
Democrats meant the coalition -- which also includes
Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals as well as the

<TEXT>
<TITLE>PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Banking Committee Chairman
William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
    "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.
    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
10 days, Proxmire said.
    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
to filed with the SEC.
    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
knowing about coming takeover attempts.
    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
business days from the current 20 business days.
    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
company violated the time period on the tender offer.
    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
requirments are properly enforced.
    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
enforced in hostile takeovers.
    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
requirements.
    The bill also would require more disclose when several
investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
    "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
about it," Proxmire said.
    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
shareholders recieve equal treatment.
    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
    He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this
year.

<TITLE>BANKERS TRUST BT> PUTS BRAZIL ON NON-ACCRUAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has
placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the high
potential of a continued suspension that would result in
reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."
    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
resumption of interest payments.
    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a
90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that
matures on April 15.

<TITLE>STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
    But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
today.
    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
accord, had been underestimated.
    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
trading partners.
    "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he
said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
not want to discuss that here.
    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
"slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.
    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
marks to support the dollar.
    "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he
said.
    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
pledges for economic stimulation.
    "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
and get it through Congress," he added.
    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
    "You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem," he
said.

<TITLE>U.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>A total 118,350 tonnes of current series
white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496
European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
said.
    Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in
France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in
Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.
    Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a
projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total
tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.
    Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes
being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.
    Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season
(1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks).
    Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export
under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864

<TITLE>MEAD MEA> EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAYTON, Ohio, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mead Corp said the outlook for its
major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and
augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
    "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and
chief executive officer said.
    Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
    In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
    Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
conditions and improved operations.
    "The combination of capital improvement programs and more
employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
operations," Roberts said.
    He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
of the year.
    Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was
particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.
